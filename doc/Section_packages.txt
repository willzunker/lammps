4. Packages :h3

This section gives an overview of the add-on packages that extend
LAMMPS functionality.  Two tables, for standard and user packages, are
below.  A brief sub-section for each package follows, with a summary
of what the package contains, how to install it, and pointers to
examples of its use or documentation provided in the LAMMPS
distribution.

4.1 "Standard packages"_#pkg_1
4.2 "User packages"_#pkg_2 :all(b)

LAMMPS includes many optional packages, which are groups of files that
enable a specific set of features.  For example, force fields for
molecular systems or granular systems are in packages.  You can see
the list of all packages by typing "make package" from within the src
directory of the LAMMPS distribution.

See "Section_start 3"_Section_start.html#start_3 of the manual for
details on how to include/exclude specific packages as part of the
LAMMPS build process, and for more details about the differences
between standard packages and user packages.

Unless otherwise noted below, every package is independent of all the
others.  I.e. any package can be included or excluded in a LAMMPS
build, independent of all other packages.  However, note that some
packages include commands derived from commands in other packages.  If
the other package is not installed, the derived command from the new
package will also not be installed when you include the new one.
E.g. the pair lj/cut/coul/long/omp command from the USER-OMP package
will not be installed as part of the USER-OMP package if the KSPACE
package is not also installed, since it contains the pair
lj/cut/coul/long command.  If you later install the KSPACE pacakge and
the USER-OMP package is already installed, both the pair
lj/cut/coul/long and lj/cut/coul/long/omp commands will be installed.

The two tables below list currently available packages in LAMMPS, with
a one-line descriptions of each.  The sub-sections below give more
details.

The "Authors" column lists a name(s) if a specific person is
responible for creating and maintaining the package.

(1) The FLD package was created by Amit Kumar and Michael Bybee from
Jonathan Higdon's group at UIUC.

(2) The OPT package was created by James Fischer (High Performance
Technologies), David Richie, and Vincent Natoli (Stone Ridge
Technolgy).

(3) The KIM package was created by Valeriu Smirichinski, Ryan Elliott,
and Ellad Tadmor (U Minn).

(4) The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott
(Sandia).  It uses the Kokkos library which was developed by Carter
Edwards, Christian, and collaborators at Sandia.

The "Doc page" column links to either a sub-section of the
"Section_howto"_Section_howto.html of the manual, or an input script
command implemented as part of the package, or to additional
documentation provided within the package.

The "Example" column is a sub-directory in the examples directory of
the distribution which has an input script that uses the package.
E.g. "peptide" refers to the examples/peptide directory.

The "Library" column lists an external library which must be built
first and which LAMMPS links to when it is built.  If it is listed as
lib/package, then the code for the library is under the lib directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  See the lib/package/README file for info
on how to build the library.  If it is not listed as lib/package, then
it is a third-party library not included in the LAMMPS distribution.

Supporting info: 

For the KOKKOS package, you have 3 choices when building.  You can
build with OMP or Cuda or Phi support.  Phi support uses Xeon Phi
chips in "native" mode.  This can be done by setting the following
variables in your Makefile.machine:

for OMP support, set OMP = yes
for Cuda support, set OMP = yes and CUDA = yes
for Phi support, set OMP = yes and MIC = yes :ul

These can also be set as additional arguments to the make command, e.g.

make g++ OMP=yes MIC=yes :pre

Building the KOKKOS package with CUDA support requires a Makefile
machine that uses the NVIDIA "nvcc" compiler, as well as an
appropriate "arch" setting appropriate to the GPU hardware and NVIDIA
software you have on your machine.  See
src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.kokkos_cuda for an example of such a machine
Makefile.

This package implements 3 commands which can be used in a LAMMPS input
script:

pair_style lj/sdk
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long
angle_style sdk :ul

These styles allow coarse grained MD simulations with the
parametrization of Shinoda, DeVane, Klein, Mol Sim, 33, 27 (2007)
(SDK), with extensions to simulate ionic liquids, electrolytes, lipids
and charged amino acids.

See the doc pages for these commands for details.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/cg-cmm.

This is the second generation implementation reducing the the clutter
of the previous version. For many systems with electrostatics, it will
be faster to use pair_style hybrid/overlay with lj/sdk and coul/long
instead of the combined lj/sdk/coul/long style.  since the number of
charged atom types is usually small.  For any other coulomb
interactions this is now required.  To exploit this property, the use
of the kspace_style pppm/cg is recommended over regular pppm. For all
new styles, input file backward compatibility is provided.  The old
implementation is still available through appending the /old
suffix. These will be discontinued and removed after the new
implementation has been fully validated.

The current version of this package should be considered beta
quality. The CG potentials work correctly for "normal" situations, but
have not been testing with all kinds of potential parameters and
simulation systems.

This package implements the "fix colvars" command which can be
used in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix allows to use "collective variables" to implement
Adaptive Biasing Force, Metadynamics, Steered MD, Umbrella
Sampling and Restraints. This code consists of two parts:

A portable collective variable module library written and maintained
by Giacomo Fiorin (ICMS, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and
Jerome Henin (LISM, CNRS, Marseille, France). This code is located in
the directory lib/colvars and needs to be compiled first.  The colvars
fix and an interface layer, exchanges information between LAMMPS and
the collective variable module. :ul

See the doc page of "fix colvars"_fix_colvars.html for more details.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/colvars

This is a very new interface that does not yet support all
features in the module and will see future optimizations
and improvements. The colvars module library is also available
in NAMD has been thoroughly used and tested there. Bugs and
problems are likely due to the interface layers code.
Thus the current version of this package should be considered
beta quality.

This package contains a LAMMPS implementation of the electron Force
Field (eFF) currently under development at Caltech, as described in
A. Jaramillo-Botero, J. Su, Q. An, and W.A. Goddard III, JCC,
2010. The eFF potential was first introduced by Su and Goddard, in
2007.

eFF can be viewed as an approximation to QM wave packet dynamics and
Fermionic molecular dynamics, combining the ability of electronic
structure methods to describe atomic structure, bonding, and chemistry
in materials, and of plasma methods to describe nonequilibrium
dynamics of large systems with a large number of highly excited
electrons. We classify it as a mixed QM-classical approach rather than
a conventional force field method, which introduces QM-based terms (a
spin-dependent repulsion term to account for the Pauli exclusion
principle and the electron wavefunction kinetic energy associated with
the Heisenberg principle) that reduce, along with classical
electrostatic terms between nuclei and electrons, to the sum of a set
of effective pairwise potentials.  This makes eFF uniquely suited to
simulate materials over a wide range of temperatures and pressures
where electronically excited and ionized states of matter can occur
and coexist.

The necessary customizations to the LAMMPS core are in place to
enable the correct handling of explicit electron properties during
minimization and dynamics.

This package contains a fast implementation for LAMMPS of
quantum-based MGPT multi-ion potentials.  The MGPT or model GPT method
derives from first-principles DFT-based generalized pseudopotential
theory (GPT) through a series of systematic approximations valid for
mid-period transition metals with nearly half-filled d bands.  The
MGPT method was originally developed by John Moriarty at Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (LLNL).

In the general matrix representation of MGPT, which can also be
applied to f-band actinide metals, the multi-ion potentials are
evaluated on the fly during a simulation through d- or f-state matrix
multiplication, and the forces that move the ions are determined
analytically.  The {mgpt} pair style in this package calculates forces
and energies using an optimized matrix-MGPT algorithm due to Tomas
Oppelstrup at LLNL.

This package contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force
field.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  It was originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard
group at CalTech.

The USER-REAXC version of ReaxFF (pair_style reax/c), implemented in
C, should give identical or very similar results to pair_style reax,
which is a ReaxFF implementation on top of a Fortran library, a
version of which library was originally authored by Adri van Duin.

The reax/c version should be somewhat faster and more scalable,
particularly with respect to the charge equilibration calculation.  It
should also be easier to build and use since there are no complicating
issues with Fortran memory allocation or linking to a Fortran library.

For technical details about this implemention of ReaxFF, see
this paper:

Parallel and Scalable Reactive Molecular Dynamics: Numerical Methods
and Algorithmic Techniques, H. M. Aktulga, J. C. Fogarty,
