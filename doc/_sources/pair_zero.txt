Description
"""""""""""

Define a global cutoff length for the purpose of building a neighbor
list and acquiring ghost atoms, but do not compute any pairwise forces
or energies.

This can be useful for fixes or computes which require a neighbor list
to enumerate pairs of atoms within some cutoff distance, but when
pairwise forces are not otherwise needed.  Examples are the :doc:`fix bond/create <fix_bond_create>`, :doc:`compute rdf <compute_rdf>`,
:doc:`compute voronoi/atom <compute_voronoi_atom>` commands.

Note that the :doc:`comm_modify cutoff <comm_modify>` command can be
used to insure communication of ghost atoms even when a pair style is
not defined, but it will not trigger neighbor list generation.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>`
commands, or by mixing as described below:

* cutoff (distance units)

This coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global cutoff
specified in the pair_style command is used.

Restrictions
