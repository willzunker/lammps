write_coeff command
===================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   write_coeff file

.. parsed-literal::

   file = name of data file to write out

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   write_coeff polymer.coeff

Description
"""""""""""

Write a text format file with the currently defined force field
coefficients in a way, that it can be read by LAMMPS with the 
:doc:`include <include>` command. In combination with the nocoeff
option of :doc:`write_data <write_data>` this can be used to move
the Coeffs sections from a data file into a separate file.

.. note::

   The write_coeff command is not yet fully implemented in two
   respects.  First, some pair styles do not yet write their coefficient
   information into the coeff file.  This means you will need to specify
   that information in your input script that reads the data file, via
   the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command.
