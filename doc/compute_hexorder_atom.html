<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates <I>qn</I> the bond-orientational 
order parameter for each atom in a group. The hexatic (<I>n</I> = 6) order 
parameter was introduced by <A HREF = "#Nelson">Nelson and Halperin</A> as a way to detect
hexagonal symmetry in two-dimensional systems. For each atom, <I>qn</I> 
is a complex number (stored as two real numbers) defined as follows:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/hexorder.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where the sum is over the <I>nnn</I> nearest neighbors 
of the central atom. The angle theta
is formed by the bond vector rij and the <I>x</I> axis. theta is calculated
only using the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> components, whereas the distance from the
central atom is calculated using all three  
<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I> components of the bond vector.
Neighbor atoms not in the group 
are included in the order parameter of atoms in the group. 
</P>
<P>The optional keyword <I>cutoff</I> defines the distance cutoff
used when searching for neighbors. The default value, also
the maximum allowable value, is the cutoff specified
by the pair style.
</P>
<P>The optional keyword <I>nnn</I> defines the number of nearest
neighbors used to calculate <I>qn</I>. The default value is 6.
If the value is NULL, then all neighbors up to the 
distance cutoff are used.
</P>
<P>The optional keyword <I>n</I> sets the degree of the order parameter. 
The default value is 6. For a perfect hexagonal lattice with 
<I>nnn</I> = 6,
<I>q</I>6 = exp(6 i phi) for all atoms, where the constant 0 < phi < pi/3 
depends only on the orientation of the lattice relative to the <I>x</I> axis.  
In an isotropic liquid, local neighborhoods may still exhibit 
weak hexagonal symmetry, but because the orientational correlation
decays quickly with distance, the value of phi will be different for
different atoms, and so when <I>q</I>6 is averaged over all the atoms 
in the system, |<<I>q</I>6>| << 1.
</P>
<P>The value of <I>qn</I> is set to zero for atoms not in the
specified compute group, as well as for atoms that have less than 
<I>nnn</I> neighbors within the distance cutoff.
</P>
<P>The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a bonded system, then the settings of
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command can remove pairwise
interactions between atoms in the same bond, angle, or dihedral.  This
is the default setting for the <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A>
command, and means those pairwise interactions do not appear in the
neighbor list.  Because this fix uses the neighbor list, it also means
those pairs will not be included in the order parameter.  This difficulty
can be circumvented by writing a dump file, and using the
<A HREF = "rerun.html">rerun</A> command to compute the order parameter for snapshots
in the dump file.  The rerun script can use a
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command that includes all pairs in
the neighbor list.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-atom array with 2 columns, giving the
real and imaginary parts <I>qn</I>, a complex number restricted to the 
unit disk of the complex plane i.e. Re(<I>qn</I>)^2 + Im(<I>qn</I>)^2 <= 1 .
</P>
<P>These values can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">Section_howto
15</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.
