compute hexorder/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID hexorder/atom cutoff type1 type2 ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
hexorder/atom = style name of this compute command
cutoff = distance within which to count neighbors (distance units)

[Examples:]

compute 1 all hexorder/atom 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates {q}6 the hexatic bond-orientational 
order parameter for each atom in a group. This order 
parameter was introduced by "Nelson and Halperin"_#Nelson as a way to detect
hexagonal symmetry in two-dimensional systems. For a each atoms, {q}6 
is a complex number (stored as two real numbers) defined as follows:

:c,image(Eqs/hexorder.jpg)

where the sum is over all atoms that are within 
the specified cutoff distance from the central atom. The angle theta
is formed by the bond vector rij and the {x} axis. theta is calculated
only using the {x} and {y} components, whereas the distance from the
central atom is calculated using all three  
{x}, {y}, and {z} components of the bond vector.
Neighbor atoms not in the group 
are included in the order parameter of atoms in the group. 

If the neighbors of the central atom lie on a hexagonal lattice, 
then |{q}6| = 1.  
The complex phase of {q}6 depends on the orientation of the 
lattice relative to the {x} axis. For a liquid in which the 
atomic neighborhood lacks orientational symmetry, |{q}6| << 1.

The value of all order parameters will be zero for atoms not in the
specified compute group. An order parameter for atoms that have no 
neighbors of the specified atom type within the cutoff distance will
be zero.

The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a bonded system, then the settings of
"special_bonds"_special_bonds.html command can remove pairwise
interactions between atoms in the same bond, angle, or dihedral.  This
is the default setting for the "special_bonds"_special_bonds.html
command, and means those pairwise interactions do not appear in the
neighbor list.  Because this fix uses the neighbor list, it also means
those pairs will not be included in the order parameter.  One way
to get around this, is to write a dump file, and use the
"rerun"_rerun.html command to compute the order parameter for snapshots
in the dump file.  The rerun script can use a
"special_bonds"_special_bonds.html command that includes all pairs in
the neighbor list.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom array with 2 columns, giving the
real and imaginary parts of {q}6, respectively.  

These values can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See "Section_howto
15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The per-atom array contain pairs of numbers representing the
real and imaginary parts of {q}6, a complex number subject to the
constraint |{q}6| <= 1.

[Restrictions:] none
