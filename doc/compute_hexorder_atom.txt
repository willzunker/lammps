compute hexorder/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID hexorder/atom keyword values ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
hexorder/atom = style name of this compute command :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {degree} :l
  {n} value = degree of order parameter :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 all hexorder/atom 
compute 1 all hexorder/atom n 4 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates {qn} the bond-orientational 
order parameter for each atom in a group. The hexatic ({n} = 6) order 
parameter was introduced by "Nelson and Halperin"_#Nelson as a way to detect
hexagonal symmetry in two-dimensional systems. For each atom, {qn} 
is a complex number (stored as two real numbers) defined as follows:

:c,image(Eqs/hexorder.jpg)

where the sum is over the {n} nearest neighbors 
of the central atom. The angle theta
is formed by the bond vector rij and the {x} axis. theta is calculated
only using the {x} and {y} components, whereas the distance from the
central atom is calculated using all three  
{x}, {y}, and {z} components of the bond vector.
Neighbor atoms not in the group 
are included in the order parameter of atoms in the group. 

The optional keyword {n} sets the degree of the order parameter. 
The default value is 6. If the neighbors of the central atom 
lie on a hexagonal lattice, then |{q}6| = 1.  
The complex phase of {q}6 depends on the orientation of the 
lattice relative to the {x} axis. For a liquid in which the 
atomic neighborhood lacks orientational symmetry, |{q}6| << 1.

The value of {qn} will be zero for atoms not in the
specified compute group. If the atom has less than {n} neighbors (within
the potential cutoff), then {qn} is set to zero.

The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a bonded system, then the settings of
"special_bonds"_special_bonds.html command can remove pairwise
interactions between atoms in the same bond, angle, or dihedral.  This
is the default setting for the "special_bonds"_special_bonds.html
command, and means those pairwise interactions do not appear in the
neighbor list.  Because this fix uses the neighbor list, it also means
those pairs will not be included in the order parameter.  One way
to get around this, is to write a dump file, and use the
"rerun"_rerun.html command to compute the order parameter for snapshots
in the dump file.  The rerun script can use a
"special_bonds"_special_bonds.html command that includes all pairs in
the neighbor list.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom array with 2 columns, giving the
real and imaginary parts of {qn}, respectively.  

These values can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See "Section_howto
15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The per-atom array contain pairs of numbers representing the
real and imaginary parts of {qn}, a complex number subject to the
constraint |{qn}| <= 1.

[Restrictions:] none

[Default:] 

The option default is {n} = 6.
