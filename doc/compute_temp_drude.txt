compute temp/drude command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp/drude :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp/drude = style name of this compute command :ul
                        
[Examples:]

compute TDRUDE all temp/drude :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the temperature based on the
center-of-mass velocities of pairs of Drude cores and Drude particles,
bonded by springs.  This compute is designed to be used with the
"thermalized Drude oscillator model"_tutorial_drude.html.  Polarizable
models in LAMMPS are described in "this
Section"_Section_howto.html#howto_25.

Specifically, this compute enables calculation of the temperature of
the Drude particles in relative coordinates with respect to their
cores.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature) and a global
vector of length 6 (KE tensor), which can be accessed by indices 1-6.
These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar or
vector values from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".  The
vector are "extensive".

The scalar value will be in temperature "units"_units.html.  The
vector values will be in energy "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

The number of core-Drude pairs contributing to the temperature is
assumed to be constant for the duration of the run.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
