fix hyper/global command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID hyper/global cutbond qfactor Vmax Tequil :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
hyper/global = style name of this fix command
cutbond = max distance at which a pair of atoms is considered bonded (distance units)
qfactor = max strain at which bias potential goes to 0.0 (unitless)
Vmax = height of bias potential (energy units)
Tequil = equilibration temperature (temperature units) :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all hyper/global 1.0 0.3 0.8 300.0 :pre

[Description:]

This fix is meant to be used with the "hyper"_hyper.html command to
perform a bond-boost hyperdynamics simulation.  The role of this fix
is a select a single pair of atoms within the system at each timestep
to add a global bias potential to, which will alter their dynamics.
This is in contrast to the "fix hyper/local"_fix_hyper_local.html
command, which can add a local bias potential to multiple pairs of
atoms at each timestep.

For a system that undergoes rare transition events, where one or more
atoms move across an energy barrier to a new potential energy basin,
the effect of the bias potential is to induce more rapid transitions.
This can lead to a dramatic speed-up in the rate at which events
occurs, without altering their relative frequencies, thus leading to
an overall dramatic speed-up in the effective elapsed time of the
simulation.

The current strain of a bond IJ is defined as

Eij = (Rij - R0ij) / R0ij :pre

Emax = is the max of the absolute value of Eij for all IJ bonds.

dVij = Vmax * (1 - (Eij/q)^2) for abs(Eij) < q
     = 0  otherwise :pre

Delta Vbias = minimum of dVij for all IJ bonds :pre

The boost factor B = exp(beta * Delta Vbias)
for a single timestep.

Thus the accumulated hypertime is simply

t_hyper = Sum (i = 1 to Nsteps) Bi * dt :pre

The {cutbond} argument is the cutoff distance for defining bonds
between pairs of nearby atoms.  A pair of atoms in their equilibrium,
minimum-energy config, which are a distance Rij < cutbond, are
defined as a bonded pair.

The {qfactor} argument is the limiting strain at which
the Vbias (the bias potential) goes to 0.0.

If {qfactor} is too big, then transitions are affected b/c
the bias energy is non-zero at the transitions.  If it is
too small than not must boost is achieved for a large system
with many bonds (some bonds Eij always exceeds qfactor).

The {Vmax} argument is the prefactor on the bias potential.

The {Tequil} argument is part of the beta term in the
exponential factor that determines how much boost is
achieved as a function of the bias potential.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option is supported by this
fix to add the energy of the bias potential to the the system's
potential energy as part of "thermodynamic output"_thermo_style.html.

This fix computes a global scalar and global vector of length 10,
which can be accessed by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  The scalar is the magnitude of
the bias potential (energy units) applied on the current timestep.
The vector stores the following quantities:

1 = boost factor on this step (unitless)
2 = max strain of any bond on this step (unitless)
3 = ID of first atom in the max-strain bond
4 = ID of second atom in the max-strain bond
5 = average # of bonds/atom on this step :ul

6 = fraction of step with no bias during this run
7 = max drift distance of any atom during this run (distance units)
8 = max bond length during this run (distance units) :ul

9 = cummulative hyper time since fix created (time units)
10 = cummulative count of event timesteps since fix created
11 = cummulative count of atoms in events since fix created :ul

The first 5 quantities are for the current timestep.  The quantities
6-8 are for the current run.  The quantities 9-11 are cummulative
across multiple runs (since the fix was defined in the input script).

For value 10, events are checked for by the "hyper"_hyper.html command
once every {Nevent} timesteps.  This value is the count of the number
of timesteps on which one (or more) events was detected.  It is NOT
the number of distinct events, since more than one physical event may
occur in the same {Nevent} time window.

For value 11, each time the "hyper"_hyper.html command checks for an
event, the event compute it uses will flag zero or more atoms as
participating in an event.  E.g. atoms that have displaced more than
some distance from the previous quench state.  This value is the count
of the number of atoms participating in any of the events that were
found.

The scalar and vector values calculated by this fix are all
"intensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the REPLICA package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the "Making
