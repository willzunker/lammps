Description
"""""""""""

Fix *rx* solves the reaction kinetic ODEs for a given reaction set that is
defined within the file associated with this command.

For a general reaction such that

.. image:: Eqs/fix_rx_reaction.jpg
   :align: center

the reaction rate equation is defined to be of the form

.. image:: Eqs/fix_rx_reactionRate.jpg
   :align: center

In the current implementation, the exponents are defined to be equal to the 
stoichiometric coefficients.  A given reaction set consisting of *n* reaction
equations will contain a total of *m* species.  A set of *m* ordinary 
differential equations (ODEs) that describe the change in concentration of a 
given species as a function of time are then constructed based on the *n* 
reaction rate equations.

The ODE systems are solved over the full DPD timestep *dt* using a 4th order 
Runge-Kutta *rk4* method with a fixed step-size *h*\ , specified by the 
*lammps_rk4* keyword. The number of ODE steps per DPD timestep for the rk4 method
is optionally specified immediately after the rk4 keyword. The ODE step-size is set as
*dt/num_steps*\ . Smaller step-sizes tend to yield more accurate results but there
is not control on the error.


----------


The filename specifies a file that contains the entire set of reaction 
kinetic equations and corresponding Arrhenius parameters.  The format of 
this file is described below.

There is no restriction on the total number or reaction equations that are 
specified.  The species names are arbitrary string names that are associated 
with the species concentrations.  
Each species in a given reaction must be preceded by it's stoichiometric 
coefficient.  The only delimiters that are recognized between the species are 
either a *+* or *=* character.  The *=* character corresponds to an 
irreversible reaction.  After specifying the reaction, the reaction rate 
constant is determined through the temperature dependent Arrhenius equation:

.. image:: Eqs/fix_rx.jpg
   :align: center

where *A* is the Arrhenius factor in time units or concentration/time units, 
*n* is the unitless exponent of the temperature dependence, and *E_a* is the 
activation energy in energy units.  The temperature dependence can be removed 
by specifying the exponent as zero.

The internal temperature of the coarse-grained particles can be used in constructing the
reaction rate constants at every DPD timestep by specifying the keyword *none*\ . 
Alternatively, the keyword *lucy* can be specified to compute a local-average particle 
internal temperature for use in the reaction rate constant expressions.  
The local-average particle internal temperature is defined as:

.. image:: Eqs/fix_rx_localTemp.jpg
   :align: center

where the Lucy function is expressed as:

.. image:: Eqs/fix_rx_localTemp2.jpg
   :align: center

The self-particle interaction is included in the above equation.


----------


The format of a tabulated file is as follows (without the parenthesized comments):

.. parsed-literal::

   # Rxn equations and parameters                                               (one or more comment or blank lines)

.. parsed-literal::

   1.0 hcn + 1.0 no2 = 1.0  no + 0.5 n2  + 0.5 h2 + 1.0 co   2.49E+01 0.0 1.34  (rxn equation, A, n, Ea)
   1.0 hcn + 1.0  no = 1.0  co + 1.0 n2  + 0.5 h2            2.16E+00 0.0 1.52   
   ...
   1.0  no + 1.0  co = 0.5  n2 + 1.0 co2                     1.66E+06 0.0 0.69

A section begins with a non-blank line whose 1st character is not a
"#"; blank lines or lines starting with "#" can be used as comments
between sections.

Following a blank line, the next N lines list the N reaction equations.  
Each species within the reaction equation is specified through its 
stoichiometric coefficient and a species tag.  Reactant species are specified 
on the left-hand side of the equation and product species are specified on the 
right-hand side of the equation.  After specifying the reactant and product 
species, the final three arguments of each line represent the Arrhenius 
parameter *A*\ , the temperature exponent *n*\ , and the activation energy *Ea*\ .

Note that the species tags that are defined in the reaction equations are 
used by the :doc:`fix eos/table/rx <fix_eos_table_rx>` command to define the
thermodynamic properties of each species.  Furthermore, the number of species 
molecules (i.e., concentration) can be specified either with the :doc:`set <set>` 
command using the "d_" prefix or by reading directly the concentrations from a 
data file.  For the latter case, the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command with the
fix keyword should be specified, where the fix-ID will be the "fix rx`ID with a <SPECIES">`_ suffix, e.g.

fix          foo all rx reaction.file ...
read_data    data.dpd fix foo_SPECIES NULL Species
