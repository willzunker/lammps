Description
"""""""""""

Style *exp6/rx* is used in reaction DPD simulations, where the coarse-grained (CG) 
particles are composed of *m* species whose reaction rate kinetics are determined 
from a set of *n* reaction rate equations through the :doc:`fix rx <fix_rx>` command.  
The species of one CG particle can interact with a species in a neighboring CG 
particle through a site-site interaction potential model.  The *exp6/rx* style 
computes an exponential-6 potential given by

.. image:: Eqs/pair_exp6_rx.jpg
   :align: center

where the *epsilon* parameter determines the depth of the potential
minimum located at *Rm*\ , and *alpha* determines the softness of the repulsion.

The coefficients must be defined for each species in a given particle type 
via the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples above, where 
the first argument is the filename that includes the exponential-6 parameters 
for each species.  The file includes the species tag followed by the *alpha*\ , 
*epsilon* and *Rm* parameters. The format of the file is described below.

The second and third arguments specify the site-site interaction 
potential between two species contained within two different particles.  
The species tags must either correspond to the species defined in the reaction
kinetics files specified with the :doc:`fix rx <fix_rx>` command 
or they must correspond to the tag "1fluid", signifying interaction 
with a product species mixture determined through a one-fluid approximation.  
The interaction potential is weighted by the geometric average of the 
concentrations of the two species.  The coarse-grained potential is 
stored before and after the reaction kinetics solver is applied, where the 
difference is defined to be the internal chemical energy (uChem).

The fourth and fifth arguments specify the *Rm* and *epsilon* scaling exponents.

The final argument specifies the interaction cutoff.


----------


The format of a tabulated file is as follows (without the parenthesized comments):

.. parsed-literal::

   # exponential-6 parameters for various species      (one or more comment or blank lines)

.. parsed-literal::

   h2o  exp6  11.00 0.02 3.50                          (species, exp6, alpha, Rm, epsilon)
   no2  exp6  13.60 0.01 3.70
   ...
   co2  exp6  13.00 0.03 3.20

A section begins with a non-blank line whose 1st character is not a
"#"; blank lines or lines starting with "#" can be used as comments
between sections.

Following a blank line, the next N lines list the species and their 
corresponding parameters.  The first argument is the species tag,
the second argument is the exp6 tag, the 3rd argument is the *alpha* 
parameter (energy units), the 4th argument is the *epsilon* parameter 
(energy-distance^6 units), and the 5th argument is the *Rm* 
parameter (distance units).  If a species tag of "1fluid" is listed as a 
pair coefficient, a one-fluid approximation is specified where a 
concentration-dependent combination of the parameters is computed 
through the following equations:

   :align: center

where

   :align: center

and xa and xb are the mole fractions of a and b, respectively, which
comprise the gas mixture.

**Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info**\ :

This pair style does not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

This style does not support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` shift option
for the energy of the exp() and 1/r^6 portion of the pair interaction.

This style does not support the pair_modify tail option for adding long-range
tail corrections to energy and pressure for the A,C terms in the
pair interaction.
