hyper command :h3

[Syntax:]

hyper N Nevent fixID computeID keyword values ... :pre

N = # of timesteps to run :ulb,l
Nevent = check for events every this many steps :l
fixID = ID of a fix that applies a global or local bias potential :l
computeID = ID of a compute that identifies when an event has occurred :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {min} or {time} :l
  {min} values = etol ftol maxiter maxeval
    etol = stopping tolerance for energy, used in quenching
    ftol = stopping tolerance for force, used in quenching
    maxiter = max iterations of minimize, used in quenching
    maxeval = max number of force/energy evaluations, used in quenching
  {time} value = {steps} or {clock}
    {steps} = simulation runs for N timesteps (default)
    {clock} = simulation runs until hyper time exceeds N timesteps :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

hyper 5000 100 global event :pre

[Description:]

Run a bond-boost hyperdynamics (HD) simulation where time is
accelerated by application of a bias potential to a one or more pairs
of atoms in the system.  This command can be used to run both global
and local hyperdyamics.  In global HD a single bond (nearby pair of
atoms) within the system is biased on a given timestep.  In local HD
multiple bonds (separated by a sufficient distance) can be biased
simultaneously at each timestep.

Make next paragraph more HD-specific.

Both global and local HD are described in "this paper"_#Voter2013 by
Art Voter and collaborators.  They are methods for performing
accelerated dynamics that is suitable for infrequent-event systems
that obey first-order kinetics.  A good overview of accelerated
dynamics methods for such systems in given in "this review
paper"_#Voter2002prd from the same group.  To quote from the paper:
"The dynamical evolution is characterized by vibrational excursions
within a potential basin, punctuated by occasional transitions between
basins."  The transition probability is characterized by p(t) =
k*exp(-kt) where k is the rate constant.  Running multiple replicas
gives an effective enhancement in the timescale spanned by the
multiple simulations, while waiting for an event to occur.

How different than PRD.

An HD run has several stages, which are repeated each time an "event"
occurs, as defined below.  The logic for a HD run is as follows:

quench
reset list of bonds :pre

while (time remains):
  run dynamics for Nevery steps
  quench
  check for an event
  if event occurred: reset list of bonds
  restore pre-quench state :pre

Explain each of the steps above.  Explain what list of bonds is and
how event is detected.

Explain the specified fix and compute.

Statistics about the number of events, the number of bonds that a bias
potential is applied to, the accumulated hyper time, etc are stored by
the fix and can be output with thermodynamic output.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the REPLICA
package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section
for more info on packages.

NOTE: is this true?
This command cannot be used when any fixes are defined that keep track
of elapsed time to perform time-dependent operations.  Examples
include the "ave" fixes such as "fix ave/chunk"_fix_ave_chunk.html.
Also "fix dt/reset"_fix_dt_reset.html and "fix
deposit"_fix_deposit.html.

[Related commands:]

"fix hyper/global"_fix_hyper_global.html, "fix
hyper/local"_fix_hyper_local.html, "compute
event/displace"_compute_event_displace.html

[Default:]

The option defaults are min = 0.1 0.1 40 50 and time = steps.
