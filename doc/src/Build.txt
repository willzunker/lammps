Build LAMMPS :h2

LAMMPS can be built as an executable or library from source code via
either CMake or traditional make.  As an alternative you can download
a pre-built executable file as described on the "Install"_Install.html
doc page.

If you have problems building LAMMPS, it is often due to software
issues on your local machine.  If you can, find a local expert to
help.  If you're still stuck, send an email to the "LAMMPS mail
