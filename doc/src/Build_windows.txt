General remarks :h4,link(general)

LAMMPS is developed and tested primarily on Linux machines.  The vast
majority of HPC clusters and supercomputers today runs on Linux as well.
Thus portability to other platforms is desired, but not always achieved.
The LAMMPS developers strongly rely on LAMMPS users giving feedback and
providing assistance in resolving portability issues. This particularly
true for compiling LAMMPS on Windows, since this platform has significant
differences with some low-level functionality.


Running Linux on Windows :h4,link(linux)

So before trying to build LAMMPS on Windows, please consider if using
the pre-compiled Windows binary packages are sufficient for your needs
(as an aside, those packages themselves are build on a Linux machine
using cross-compilers).  If it is necessary for your to compile LAMMPS
on a Windows machine (e.g. because it is your main desktop), please also
consider using a virtual machine software and run a Linux virtual machine,
or - if have a recently updated Windows 10 installation - consider using
the Windows subsystem for Linux, which allows to run a bash shell from
Ubuntu and from there on, you can pretty much use that shell like you
are running on an Ubuntu Linux machine (e.g. installing software via
apt-get). For more details on that, please see "this tutorial"_Howto_bash.html


Using GNU GCC ported to Windows :h4,link(gnu)

One option for compiling LAMMPS on Windows natively, that has been known
to work in the past is to install a bash shell, unix shell utilities,
perl, GNU make, and a GNU compiler ported to Windows. The Cygwin package
provides a unix/linux interface to low-level Windows functions, so LAMMPS
can be compiled on Windows. The necessary (minor) modifications to LAMMPS
are included, but may not always up-to-date for recently added functionality
and the corresponding new code. A machine makefile for using cygwin for
the old build system is provided. The CMake build system is untested
for this; you will have to request that makefiles are generated and
manually set the compiler.  In case of problems, you are recommended to
contact somebody with experience in using cygwin.  If you come across
portability problems requiring changes to the LAMMPS source code, or
figure out corrections yourself, please report them on the lammps-users
mailing list, or file them as an issue or pull request on the LAMMPS
github project.


Using a cross-compiler :h4,link(cross)

If you need to provide custom LAMMPS binaries for Windows, but do not
need to do the compilation on Windows, please consider using a Linux
to Windows cross-compiler. This is how currently the Windows binary
packages are created by the LAMMPS developers. Because of that, this is
probably the currently best tested and supported way to build LAMMPS
executables for Windows. Please keep in mind, though, that this only
applies to compiling. Whether the resulting binaries do work correctly
is no tested. The LAMMPS developers rely on the feedback of the users
of the precompiled LAMMPS packages for Windows to become aware of
issues and then try to apply corrections, if possible.


Native Visual C++ support :h4,link(native)

Support for the Visual C++ compilers is currently not available. The
CMake build system is capable of creating suitable a Visual Studio
style build environment, but the LAMMPS code itself is not fully ported
to support Visual C++. Volunteers to take on this task are welcome.
