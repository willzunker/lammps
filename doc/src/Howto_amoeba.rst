AMOEBA and HIPPO force fields
=============================

The AMOEBA and HIPPO polarizable force fields were developed by Jay
Ponder's group at U Washington at St Louis.  Their implementation in
LAMMPS was done using code provided by the Ponder group from their
`Tinker MD code <https://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/>`_ written in F90.

NOTE: what version of AMOEBA and HIPPO does LAMMPS implement?

These force fields can be used when polarization effects are desired
in simulations of water, organic molecules, and biomolecules including
proteins, provided that parameterizations (force field files) are
available for the systems you are interested in.  Files in the LAMMPS
potentials with a "amoeba" or "hippo" suffix can be used.  The Tinker
distribution and website may have other such files.

Note that currently, HIPPO can only be used for water systems, but
HIPPO files for a variety of small organic and biomolecules are in
preparation by the Ponder group.  They will be included in the LAMMPS
distribution when available.

The :doc:`pair_style amoeba <pair_amoeba>` doc page gives a brief
description of the AMOEBA and HIPPO force fields.  Further details for
AMOEBA are in these papers: :ref:`(Ren) <amoeba-Ren>`, :ref:`(Shi)
<amoeba-Shi>`.  Further details for HIPPO are in this paper:
:ref:`(Rackers) <amoeba-Rackers>`.

----------

To use the AMOEBA force field in LAMMPS you should use these commands
appropriately in your input script.  The only change needed for a
HIPPO simulation is for the pair_style and pair_coeff commands.
See examples/amoeba for example input scripts.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   units real                         # required
   atom_style hybrid full amoeba
   bond_style amoeba
   angle_style amoeba
   dihedral_style amoeba
   fix amtype all property/atom i_amtype ghost yes    # fix ID matches read_data command
   fix amoeba1 all property/atom &                    # fix ID (amoeba12) does not matter
       i_amgroup i_ired i_xaxis i_yaxis i_zaxis d_pval ghost yes
   fix amoeba2 all property/atom i_polaxe             
   read_data filename fix amtype NULL "Tinker Types"  # fix ID matches fix command
   pair_coeff * * ../potentials/protein.prm.amoeba ../potentials/protein.key.amoeba  # for AMOEBA
   pair_coeff * * ../potentials/water.prm.hippo ../potentials/water.key.hippo  # for HIPPO
   special_bonds lj/coul 0.5 0.5 0.5 one/five yes

Both AMOEBA and HIPPO use amoeba for bond/angle/dihedral styles,
assuming the molecular system has bonds, angles, or dihedrals.  These
style commands must be be used before the data file is read, as the
data file defines the coefficients for the various bond/angle/dihedral
types.  The pair_style command can come after the read_data command,
as no pair coefficients are defined in the data file.

The :doc:`fix property/atom <fix_property_atom>` commands are required
to create per-atom data used by the AMOEBA/HIPPO force fields, some of
which is defined in the LAMMPS data file.  The LAMMPS data file should
be produced as a pre-processing step by the tinker2lmp.py Python
script in tools/amoeba with a command like one of the following.
The tools/amoeba/README file has more details on using this tool.

.. code-block:: bash

   % python tinker2lmp.py -xyz tinker.xyz -amoeba protein.prm.amoeba -data lmp.data  # AMOEBA for non-periodic systems
   % python tinker2lmp.py -xyz tinker.xyz -amoeba protein.prm.amoeba -data lmp.data -pbc 10.0 20.0 15.0  # AMOEBA for periodic systems
   % python tinker2lmp.py -xyz tinker.xyz -hippo water.prm.hippo -data lmp.data  # HIPPO for non-periodic systems
   % python tinker2lmp.py -xyz tinker.xyz -hippo water.prm.hippo -data lmp.data -pbc 10.0 20.0 15.0  # HIPPO for periodic systems

Note that two input files are needed and a LAMMPS data file (lmp.data)
is produced. The data file will have information on Tinker atom types
and AMOEBA/HIPPO force field parameters for bonds, angles, and
dihedrals.

The first input is an XYZ file listing all the atoms in the
system.

NOTE: is this a Tinker-augmented-XYZ format or standard?  In either
case, how do we suggest LAMMPS users come up with these files?

The second input is an AMOEBA or HIPPO PRM (force field) file.  The
format of these files is defined by Tinker.  A few such files are
provided in the LAMMPS potentials directory.  Others may be available
in the Tinker distribution or from the Ponder group.

The pair_coeff command should specify the same PRM file, and
optionally a Tinker-format KEY file.  See the :doc:`pair_style amoeba
<pair_amoeba>` doc page for more information about Tinker PRM and KEY
files.

Finally, the :doc:`special_bonds <special_bonds>` command is used to
set all LJ and Coulombic 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 weighting factors to non-zero
and non-unity values, and to generate a per-atom list of 1-5 neighbors
as well.  This is to insure all bond-topology neighbors are included
in the neighbor lists used by AMOEBA/HIPPO.  These force fields apply
their own custom weighting factors to all these terms, including the
1-5 neighbors.
