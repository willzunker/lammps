Pre-built Ubuntu Linux executables :h4,link(ubuntu)

A pre-built LAMMPS executable suitable for running on the latest
Ubuntu Linux versions, can be downloaded as a Debian package.  This
allows you to install LAMMPS with a single command, and stay
up-to-date with the current version of LAMMPS by simply updating your
operating system.

To install the appropriate personal-package archive (PPA), do the
following once:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gladky-anton/lammps
sudo apt-get update :pre

To install LAMMPS do the following once:

sudo apt-get install lammps-daily :pre

This downloads an executable named "lmp_daily" to your box, which
can then be used in the usual way to run input scripts:

lmp_daily -in in.lj :pre

To update LAMMPS to the most current version, do the following:

sudo apt-get update :pre

which will also update other packages on your system.

To get a copy of the current documentation and examples:

sudo apt-get install lammps-daily-doc :pre

which will download the doc files in
/usr/share/doc/lammps-daily-doc/doc and example problems in
/usr/share/doc/lammps-doc/examples.

Note that you may still wish to download the tarball to get potential
files and auxiliary tools.

To un-install LAMMPS, do the following:

sudo apt-get remove lammps-daily :pre

Note that the lammps-daily executable is built with the following
sequence of make commands, as if you had done the same with the
unpacked tarball files in the src directory:

make yes-all; make no-lib; make openmpi

Thus it builds with FFTW3 and OpenMPI.

Thanks to Anton Gladky (gladky.anton at gmail.com) for setting up this
Ubuntu package capability.

Pre-built Gentoo Linux executable :h4,link(gentoo)

LAMMPS is part of Gentoo's main package tree and can be installed by
typing:

% emerge --ask lammps :pre

Note that in Gentoo the LAMMPS source is downloaded and the package is
built on the your machine.

Certain LAMMPS packages can be enable via USE flags, type

% equery uses lammps :pre

for details.

Thanks to Nicolas Bock and Christoph Junghans (LANL) for setting up
this Gentoo capability.
