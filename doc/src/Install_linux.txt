Pre-built binary RPMs for Fedora/RedHat/CentOS/openSUSE :h4,link(rpm)

Pre-built LAMMPS executables for various Linux distributions
can be downloaded as binary RPM files from this site:

"http://rpm.lammps.org"_http://rpm.lammps.org

There are multiple package variants supporting serial, parallel and
Python wrapper versions.  The LAMMPS binaries contain all optional
packages included in the source distribution except: GPU, KIM, REAX,
and USER-INTEL.

Installation instructions for the various versions are here:

"http://rpm.lammps.org/install.html"_http://rpm.lammps.org/install.html

The instructions show how to enable the repository in the respective
system's package management system.  Installing and updating are then
straightforward and automatic.  

Thanks to Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U, akohlmey at gmail.com) for setting
up this RPM capability.

Pre-built Ubuntu Linux executables :h4,link(ubuntu)

A pre-built LAMMPS executable suitable for running on the latest
Ubuntu Linux versions, can be downloaded as a Debian package.  This
allows you to install LAMMPS with a single command, and stay
up-to-date with the current version of LAMMPS by simply updating your
operating system.

To install the appropriate personal-package archive (PPA), do the
following once:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gladky-anton/lammps
sudo apt-get update :pre

To install LAMMPS do the following once:

sudo apt-get install lammps-daily :pre

This downloads an executable named "lammps-daily" to your box, which
can then be used in the usual way to run input scripts:

lammps-daily < in.lj :pre

To update LAMMPS to the most current version, do the following:

sudo apt-get update :pre

which will also update other packages on your system.

To get a copy of the current documentation and examples:

sudo apt-get install lammps-daily-doc :pre

which will download the doc files in
/usr/share/doc/lammps-daily-doc/doc and example problems in
/usr/share/doc/lammps-doc/examples.

Note that you may still wish to download the tarball to get potential
files and auxiliary tools.

To un-install LAMMPS, do the following:

sudo apt-get remove lammps-daily :pre

Note that the lammps-daily executable is built with the following
sequence of make commands, as if you had done the same with the
unpacked tarball files in the src directory:

make yes-all; make no-lib; make openmpi

Thus it builds with FFTW3 and OpenMPI.

Thanks to Anton Gladky (gladky.anton at gmail.com) for setting up this
Ubuntu package capability.

Pre-built Gentoo Linux executable :h4,link(gentoo)

LAMMPS is part of Gentoo's main package tree and can be installed by
typing:

% emerge --ask lammps :pre

Note that in Gentoo the LAMMPS source is downloaded and the package is
built on the your machine.

Certain LAMMPS packages can be enable via USE flags, type

% equery uses lammps :pre

for details.

Thanks to Nicolas Bock and Christoph Junghans (LANL) for setting up
this Gentoo capability.
