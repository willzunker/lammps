Body styles :h3

Classes that define body particles are derived from the Body class.
Body particles can represent complex entities, such as surface meshes
of discrete points, collections of sub-particles, deformable objects,
etc.

See "Section 6.14"_Section_howto.html#howto_14 of the manual for
an overview of using body particles and the "body"_body.html doc page
for details on the various body styles LAMMPS supports.  New styles
can be created to add new kinds of body particles to LAMMPS.

Body_nparticle.cpp is an example of a body particle that is treated as
a rigid body containing N sub-particles.

Here is a brief description of methods you define in your new derived
class.  See body.h for details.

data_body: process a line from the Bodies section of a data file
noutrow: number of sub-particles output is generated for
noutcol: number of values per-sub-particle output is generated for
output: output values for the Mth sub-particle
pack_comm_body: body attributes to communicate every timestep
unpack_comm_body: unpacking of those attributes
pack_border_body: body attributes to communicate when reneighboring is done
unpack_border_body: unpacking of those attributes :tb(s=:)
