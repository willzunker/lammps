Build LAMMPS as a shared library :h3

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS as a shared library are given in
"Section 2.4"_Section_start.html#start_4.  A shared library is one
that is dynamically loadable, which is what Python requires to wrap
LAMMPS.  On Linux this is a library file that ends in ".so", not ".a".

From the src directory, type

make foo mode=shlib :pre

where foo is the machine target name, such as mpi or serial.
This should create the file liblammps_foo.so in the src directory, as
well as a soft link liblammps.so, which is what the Python wrapper will
load by default.  Note that if you are building multiple machine
versions of the shared library, the soft link is always set to the
most recently built version.

NOTE: If you are building LAMMPS with an MPI or FFT library or other
auxiliary libraries (used by various packages), then all of these
extra libraries must also be shared libraries.  If the LAMMPS
shared-library build fails with an error complaining about this, see
"Section 2.4"_Section_start.html#start_4 for more details.
