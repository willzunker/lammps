Description
"""""""""""

The *cross* angle style uses a potential that couples the bond stretches of
a bend with the angle stretch of that bend:

.. image:: Eqs/angle_cross.jpg
   :align: center

where r12,0 is the rest value of the bond length between atom 1 and 2,
r32,0 is the rest value of the bond length between atom 2 and 2,
and theta0 is the rest value of the angle. KSS is the force constant of
the bond stretch-bond stretch term and KBS0 and KBS1 are the force constants
of the bond stretch-angle stretch terms.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
:doc:`angle\_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read\_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* KSS (energy/distance\^2)
* KBS0 (energy/distance/rad)
* KBS1 (energy/distance/rad)
* r12,0 (distance)
* r32,0 (distance)
* theta0 (degrees)

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of KBS0 and KBS1 are in energy/distance/radian.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER\_YAFF package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc
page for more info.
