compute pe/e3b command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID pe/e3b :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
pe/e3b = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all pe/e3b :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the contribution of "pair_style e3b"_pair_e3b.html to the potential energy.
The specified group must be "all".
See the "compute pe/atom"_compute_pe_atom.html command if you want per-atom
energies.
These per-atom values could be summed for a group of atoms via the "compute reduce"_compute_reduce.html command.

The "pair_style e3b"_pair_e3b.html potential is composed of 4 terms.
This compute calculates the total e3b contribution to the energy as well as each of the four terms.
The four terms are stored as a 4-element vector in the order pe_Ea, pe_Eb, pe_Ec, pe_E2.
See "pair_style e3b"_pair_e3b.html for more details, and an example script can be found in the examples/USER/e3b directory.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar (the total e3b energy) and a global
vector of length 4 (the four energy terms), which can be accessed by indices
1-4.  These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar
or vector values from a compute as input.  See the "Howto
output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The scalar and vector values calculated by this compute are
"extensive" and in energy
"units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

This compute must be used with "pair_style e3b"_pair_e3b.html.

[Related commands:]

"pair_style e3b"_pair_e3b.html,
"compute pe"_compute_pe.html,
"compute pe/atom"_compute_pe_atom.html

[Default:] none
