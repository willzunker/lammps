compute spin command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID spin :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
spin = style name of this compute command

[Examples:]

compute out_mag all spin

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the magnetic quantities for a system 
of atoms having spins.

This compute calculates 6 magnetic quantities.
The three first ones are the x,y and z cooredinates of the total magnetization.
The fourth quantity is the norm of the total magnetization.
The fifth one is referred to as the spin temperature, according
to the work of "(Nurdin)"_#Nurdin1. 
  
The sixth quantity is the magnetic energy. 


A simple way to output the results of the compute spin
calculation to a file is to use the "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html
command, for example:

compute mag all compute/spin
fix outmag all ave/time 1 1 50 c_mag[2] c_mag[3] c_mag[4] c_mag[7] file mag.dat

[Output info:]

The array values are "intensive".  The array values will be in
metal units ("units"_units.html).

[Restrictions:] 

The {spin} compute is part of the SPIN package.
This compute is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with this package.
See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Related commands:] none


[Default:] none
