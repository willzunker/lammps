fix force/spin command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group force/spin style args :pre

ID, group are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
force/spin = style name of this fix command :l
style = {zeeman} or {aniso} :l
  {zeeman} args = H x y z 
    H = intensity of the magnetic field (in Tesla)
    x y z = vector direction of the field
  {aniso} args = K x y z
    K = intensity of the magnetic anisotropy (in eV)
    x y z = vector direction of the anisotropy
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all force/spin zeeman 0.1 0.0 0.0 1.0
fix 1 all force/spin aniso 0.001 0.0 0.0 1.0


[Description:]

Impose a force torque to each magnetic spin in the group.

Style {zeeman} is used for the simulation of the interaction 
between the magnetic spins in the defined group and an external 
magnetic field.

Style {aniso} is used to simulate an easy axis or an easy plane 
for the magnetic spins in the defined group. 
If K>0, an easy axis is defined, and if K<0, an easy plane is
defined.

In both cases, x y z impose is the vector direction for the force. 
Only the direction of the vector is important; it's length is ignored.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option is supported by this
fix to add the gravitational potential energy of the system to the
system's potential energy as part of "thermodynamic
output"_thermo_style.html.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {respa} option is supported by this
fix. This allows to set at which level of the "r-RESPA"_run_style.html
integrator the fix is adding its forces. Default is the outermost level.

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
"output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  This scalar is the
gravitational potential energy of the particles in the defined field,
namely mass * (g dot x) for each particles, where x and mass are the
particles position and mass, and g is the gravitational field.  The
scalar value calculated by this fix is "extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.
