fix force/spin command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group force/spin style args :pre

ID, group are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
force/spin = style name of this fix command :l
style = {zeeman} or {aniso} :l
  {zeeman} args = H x y z 
    H = intensity of the magnetic field (in Tesla)
    x y z = vector direction of the field
  {aniso} args = K x y z
    K = intensity of the magnetic anisotropy (in eV)
    x y z = vector direction of the anisotropy :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all force/spin zeeman 0.1 0.0 0.0 1.0
fix 1 all force/spin aniso 0.001 0.0 0.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Impose a force torque to each magnetic spin in the group.

Style {zeeman} is used for the simulation of the interaction 
between the magnetic spins in the defined group and an external 
magnetic field:

:c,image(Eqs/force_spin_zeeman.pdf)

with mu0 the vacuum permeability, muB the Bohr magneton (muB = 5.788 eV/T 
in metal units), 

Style {aniso} is used to simulate an easy axis or an easy plane 
for the magnetic spins in the defined group: 

:c,image(Eqs/force_spin_aniso.pdf)

with n defining the direction of the anisotropy, and K (in eV) its intensity. 
If K>0, an easy axis is defined, and if K<0, an easy plane is defined.

In both cases, the choice of (x y z) imposes the vector direction for the force. 
Only the direction of the vector is important; it's length is ignored.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

[Restrictions:]

The {force/spin} style is part of the SPIN package. 
This style is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with this package, and
if the atom_style "spin" was declared. 
See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.
