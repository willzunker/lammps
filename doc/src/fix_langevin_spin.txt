fix langevin/spin command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID langevin/spin T Tdamp Ldamp seed :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
langevin/spin = style name of this fix command :l
T = desired temperature of the bath (temperature units, K in metal units) :l
Tdamp = transverse magnetic damping parameter (adim) :l
Ldamp = longitudinal magnetic damping parameter (adim) :l
seed = random number seed to use for white noise (positive integer) :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 2 all langevin/spin 300.0 0.01 0.0 21 :pre

[Description:]

Apply a Langevin thermostat as described in "(Mayergoyz)"_#Mayergoyz1 to the 
magnetic spins associated to the atoms. 
Used with "fix integration spin"_fix_integration_spin.html, this command performs 
Brownian dynamics (BD). 
A random torque and a transverse dissipation are applied to each spin i according to
the following stochastic differential equation:

:c,image(Eqs/fix_langevin_spin_sLLG.jpg)

with lambda the transverse damping, and eta a random verctor.

The components of eta are drawn from a Gaussian probability law. Their amplitude 
is defined as a proportion of the temperature of the external thermostat T (in K 
in metal units).

More details about this implementation are reported in "(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida1.

Note: The random # {seed} must be a positive integer.  A Marsaglia random
number generator is used.  Each processor uses the input seed to
generate its own unique seed and its own stream of random numbers.
Thus the dynamics of the system will not be identical on two runs on
different numbers of processors.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  Because the state of the random number generator
is not saved in restart files, this means you cannot do "exact"
restarts with this fix, where the simulation continues on the same as
if no restart had taken place.  However, in a statistical sense, a
restarted simulation should produce the same behavior.

This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

The {langevin/spin} fix is part of the SPIN package.
This style is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with this package.
See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

The numerical integration has to be performed with {fix/integration/spin} 
when {langevin/spin} is enabled.

"pair spin"_pair_spin.html

[Default:] none
