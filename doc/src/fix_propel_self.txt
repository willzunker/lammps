fix propel/self command  :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID propel/self mode magnitude keyword values ...

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
propel/self = style name of this fix command :l
mode = velocity or quaternion :l
magnitude = magnitude of the active force :l
one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args :l
keyword = {types} :l
  {types} values = one or more atom types
  
:ule

[Examples:]

fix active_group all propel/self velocity 1.0
fix constant_velocity all viscous 1.0 :pre

fix active_group all propel/self quaternion 1.0 :pre

fix active all propel/self quaternion 1.0 types 1 2 4 :pre


[Description:]

Adds a force of a constant magnitude to each atom in the group. The nature in
which the force is added depends on the mode.

For mode = velocity, the active force acts along the velocity vector of each atom. This can
be interpreted as a velocity-dependent friction, such as proposed by "(Erdmann)"_#Erdmann.

For mode = quaternion the force is along the axis obtained by rotating the z-axis along the
atom's quaternion. In other words, the force is along the z-axis in the atom's body
frame. This mode requires all atoms in the group to have a quaternion, so atom_style should
either be ellipsoid or body.  In combination with Langevin thermostat for translation and
rotation in the overdamped regime, the quaternion mode corresponds to the active Brownian
particle model introduced by "(Henkes)"_#Henkes, "(Bialke)"_#Bialke and "(Fily)"_#Fily.

By default, this fix is applied to all atoms in the group. You can override this
behavior by specifying the atom types the fix should work on through the {types}
keyword.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix is not imposed  during minimization.

[Restrictions:]

In quaternion mode, this fix makes use of per-atom quaternions to take into account the fact
that the orientation can rotate and hence the direction of the active force can
change. Therefore, the quaternion mode of this fix only works with atom_styles that have a
quaternion.
