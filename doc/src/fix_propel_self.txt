fix active command  :pre

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID magnitude

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
addforce = style name of this fix command :l
magnitude = magnitude of the active force :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix active_group all active 1.0
fix constant_velocity all viscous 1.0

[Description:]

Adds a force of a constant magnitude to each atom in the group. The direction
of the force is along the axis obtained by rotating the z-axis along the atom's
quaternion. In other words, the force is along the z-axis in the atom's body
frame.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix is not imposed  during minimization.

[Restrictions:]

This fix makes use of per-atom quaternions to take into
account the fact that the orientation can rotate and hence the direction
of the active force can change. Therefore, this fix only works with
ellipsoidal particles.
