fix propel/self command  :pre

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID propel/self mode magnitude

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
propel/self = style name of this fix command :l
mode = velocity or quaternion :l
magnitude = magnitude of the active force :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix active_group all propel/self velocity 1.0
fix constant_velocity all viscous 1.0

[Description:]

Adds a force of a constant magnitude to each atom in the group. The nature in
which the force is added depends on the mode.
For mode = velocity, the active force acts along the velocity vector of each
atom.
For mode = quaternion the force is along the axis obtained by rotating the
z-axis along the atom's quaternion. In other words, the force is along the
z-axis in the atom's body frame. This mode requires all atoms in the group
to have a quaternion, so atom_style should either be ellipsoid or body.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix is not imposed  during minimization.

[Restrictions:]

This fix makes use of per-atom quaternions to take into
account the fact that the orientation can rotate and hence the direction
of the active force can change. Therefore, this fix only works with
ellipsoidal particles.
