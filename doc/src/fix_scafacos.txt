fix scafacos command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID scafacos solver tol_type tolerance :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
scafacos = style name of this fix command
solver = NULL or name of solver for electro-statics computation :ul
tol_type = NULL or one of (energy, energy_rel, field, field_rel, potential, potential_rel)
tolerance = only of tol_type is given, value of tolerance

[Examples:]

fix 1 all scafacos fmm
fix 1 all scafacos p3m field 0.001

[Description:]

This fix style is a wrapper for the Coulomb solver library ScaFaCoS,
which provides a selection of different solvers for the compuation
of electro-static interaction. If you download and build ScaFaCoS,
it can be called as libray by LAMMPS via this fix, which allows the
selection of a solver as well as setting the tolerance of a chosen
parameter (if compatible with the chosen solver). 

ScaFaCoS was developed by a consortium of German research facilities
with a BMBF (German Ministry of Science and Education) funded project
in 2009-2012. Participants of the consortium were the Universities of
Bonn, Chemnitz, Stuttgart, and Wuppertal as well as the
Forschungszentrum Juelich.

The library is available at "http://scafacos.de" or can be cloned
from the git-repository "git://github.com/scafacos/scafacos.git".
