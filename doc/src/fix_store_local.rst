Description
"""""""""""

This fix provides the ability to store local data generated by another
LAMMPS command, including some pair and bond styles, so it can be
output. One examples, shown above, is the
:doc:`bpm/simple bondstyle <bond_bpm_simple>` which allows bonds to
break and passes information on the broken bonds to this fix. A
:doc:`dump local <dump_local>` command can then output the list of
broken bonds

This fix continuously accumulates local data over intervals of *N*
timesteps. At the end of each interval, all of the saved accumulated
data is deleted to make room for new data. Individual datum may
therefore persist anywhere between *1* to *N* timesteps depending on
when they are saved. This data can be accessed by a
:doc:`dump local <dump_local>` command. To ensure all data is output,
the dump frequency should correspond to the same interval of *N*
timesteps. A dump frequency of an integer multiple of *N* can be used
to regularly output a sample of the accumulated data.

----------

Restart, fix_modify, run start/stop, minimize info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Accumulated local data is written to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options are
                     
relevant to this fix.  No parameter of this fix can be used with the
*start/stop* keywords of the :doc:`run <run>` command.

Output info
"""""""""""

This compute calculates a local vector or local array depending on the
number of input values.  The length of the vector or number of rows in
the array is the number of recorded, lost interactions.  If a single
input is specified, a local vector is produced.  If two or more inputs
are specified, a local array is produced where the number of columns =
the number of inputs.  The vector or array can be accessed by any
command that uses local values from a compute as input.  See the
:doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page for an overview of LAMMPS
output options.

The vector or array will be floating point values that correspond to
the specified attribute.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix must be used in conjunction with another LAMMPS command which
generates local data and passes it to this fix.  See the related
commands below for examples of such commands.
