[Description:]

Cercignani-Lampis (CL) "CL"_#CL propose a stochastic wall model which can model
the gas-wall collision realistically. Instead of mixing wall/reflect and
wall/diffusive as in Maxwell model (fix wall/maxwell), the CL model used shifted
MB distribution for the tangential velocity and exponential bessel for the
normal velocity. Two accommodation coefficients are used: one for the tangential
velocity (isotropic) and one for the normal kinetic energy. In this fix, a
generalized version "To"_#To which can account for the anisotropy of the wall
surface is implemented, there are three coefficients: two for the tangential
velocity (two components) and one for the kinetic energy. The code will
recognize automatically the normal direction of the wall and the other two
tangential directions. For example, if accomx = 0.5, accomy = 0.2, accomz = 0.3
and the wall is normal to direction y, accomx and accomz are the tangential
velocity accommodation coefficients and accomy is the normal kinetic energy
accommodation coefficients.

The {units} keyword determines the distance units used to define a wall position

A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by the
"units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal. 

A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice spacings. The
"lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to define the
lattice spacings.

[Restrictions:]

Due to its properties, this fix has has the same limitation as the the
wall/reflect. Any dimension (xyz) that has a wall must be non-periodic. It
shoudld not be used with rigid bodies such as those defined by a "fix rigid"
command.
