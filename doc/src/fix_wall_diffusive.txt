ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
wall/diffusive = style name of this fix command :l
one or more face/arg pairs may be appended :l
face = {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :l
  {xlo},{ylo},{zlo} pos = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current lo edge of simulation box

    velx, vely, velz = wall velocity along x, y, z directions
  {xhi},{yhi},{zhi} pos = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current hi edge of simulation box
    constant = number like 50.0 or 100.3 (distance units)

[Description:]

In the USER-GWBC package, the three fixes wall/diffusive, wall/ACL, wall/Maxwell are implementations of stochastic wall models. The acronym GWBC stands for Gas-Wall Boundary Conditions. Like fix wall/reflect, these fixes bound the simulation with one or more walls by puting back atoms inside whenever they cross through the wall, i.e collision event. While the wall/reflect corrsponds to mirror reflection where the reflected velocity is deterministic depending on the incoming velocity, the reflected velocity in the stochastic wall models is random. The randomness accounts for the nature of the wall, the thermal motion of the wall atoms or the surface roughness. These models are useful for simulation gas flows without describing atomistically the wall boundary and thus save significantly computation cost. 

In the wall/diffusive model, the atoms are fully thermalized by the wall and reflected diffusively. The post collision velocity distribution is a equilibrium distribution at the wall. The use of this stochastic model ressembles to wall/reflect but with four additional parameters the wall temperature and the wall velocity along 3 directions x, y, z.

The {units} keyword determines the distance units used to define a wall position

A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by the "units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal. 

A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice spacings. The "lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously used to define the lattice spacings.

[Restrictions:]

As extension of wall/reflect, this fix has has the same limitation as the the wall/reflect. Any dimension (xyz) that has a wall must be non-periodic. It shoudld not be used with rigid bodies such as those defined by a "fix rigid" command.
