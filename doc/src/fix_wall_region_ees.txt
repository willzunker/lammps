fix wall/region/ees command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID wall/region/ees region-ID epsilon sigma cutoff :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
wall/region = style name of this fix command
region-ID = region whose boundary will act as wall
epsilon = strength factor for wall-particle interaction (energy or energy/distance^2 units)
sigma = size factor for wall-particle interaction (distance units)
cutoff = distance from wall at which wall-particle interaction is cut off (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

fix wall all wall/region/ees mySphere 1.0 1.0 2.5 :pre

[Description:]

Treat the surface of the geometric region defined by the {region-ID}
as a bounding wall which interacts with nearby ellipsoidal particles according to
the EES potential introduced "fix wall/ees"_fix_wall_ees.html.

Other details of this command is the same wiht "fix wall/region"_fix_wall_region.html command. 
One may also find and exapmle of using this code in USER/ees/ under examples/ directory. 

[Restrictions:] 

This fix is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

This fix requires that atoms be ellipsoids as defined by the
"atom_style ellipsoid"_atom_style.html command.

[Default:] none
