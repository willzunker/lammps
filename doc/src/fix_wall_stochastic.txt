ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
wall/stochastic = style name of this fix command :l
one or more face/arg pairs may be appended :l
reflectionstyle = diffusive or maxwell or cercignanilampis :l
seed = random seed for stochastic wall (must be less than 900000000) :l

  {xhi},{yhi},{zhi} pos = EDGE or constant or variable
    EDGE = current hi edge of simulation box
    constant = number like 50.0 or 100.3 (distance units)

[Description:]

This fix differs from the command fix wall/reflect which is equivalent
to the mirror reflection in that the post collision velocity of the atoms
in the stochastic wall is random. The randomness can come from many sources:
thermal motion of solid atoms, the surface roughness, etc... Three
stochastic wall models are implemented.

Diffusive wall (reflectionstyle = diffusive): all the gas atoms are
reflected diffusively. Their velocity distribution corresponds to the
equilibrium distribution at the wall temperature.

Maxwell model (reflectionstyle = maxwell): the reflection is partially
diffusive and partially specular. The accommodation coefficient is the
portion of the diffusive reflection "Maxwell"_#Maxwell.

Cercignani/Lampis model: 3 accommodations coefficients are used, two
velocity accommodation coefficients and one normal kinetic energy
accommodation "CL"_#CL, "To"_#To. The code will recognize automatically
the normal direction of the wall and the other two tangential
directions. For example, if accomx = 0.5, accomy = 0.2, accomz = 0.3 and
the wall is normal to direction y, accomx and accomz are the tangential
velocity accommodation coefficients and accomy is the normal kinetic
energy accommodation coefficients.

The {units} keyword determines the distance units used to define a wall
position.  A {box} value selects standard distance units as defined by
the "units"_units.html command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or
metal.  A {lattice} value means the distance units are in lattice
spacings. The "lattice"_lattice.html command must have been previously
used to define the lattice spacings.

[Restrictions:]

Due to the similarities, this fix has the same limitation as the the
wall/reflect. Any dimension (xyz) that has a wall must be non-periodic. It
should not be used with rigid bodies such as those defined by a "fix rigid"
command. Furthermore, the wall velocity must lie on the same plane as the wall. Package USER-MISC is required to use this fix.
