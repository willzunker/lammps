kim_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

kim_style mode model args :pre

mode = {init} or {define} 
model = name of the KIM model (potential or simulator model) or NULL
args = atom type to species mapping ({define} option only, one entry per atom type) :ul

[Examples:]

kim_style init ex_sim_model_Si_mod_tersoff
kim_style define NULL Si Si
kim_style define LennardJones_Ar Ar :pre

[Description:]

The kim_style command is a high-level wrapper around the
"Knowledge Base for Interatomic Models (OpenKIM)"_https://openkim.org
repository of interatomic potentials, so that they can be used by
LAMMPS scripts.  It does not implement any computations directly, but
rather will generate LAMMPS input commands based on the information
retrieved from the OpenKIM repository.  It is primarily meant to realize
so-called "KIM Simulator Models", which are OpenKIM repository entries
of models using native features of the simulation engine, i.e. LAMMPS
in this case, but it also supports realizing conventional KIM models
via the "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command.

The kim_style command has two modes, {init} and {define}, indicated by
the first argument to the kim_style command.  An {init} mode command
must be issued [before] the simulation box is created, while the {define}
mode version may only be used [after] the simulation box exists.  The
{init} mode version is only required, if the KIM model requires it.
The second argument to the kim_style command is the KIM model ID.  It
can be set to NULL in the kim_style define command, if it was already
set in a kim_style init command.  Otherwise, the two model IDs must match.

Only the kim_style define command allows additional arguments.  Those
are used to map the atom types in LAMMPS to the available species in
the KIM model.  This is equivalent to the arguments following
"pair_coeff * *" in a "kim"_pair_kim.html pair style. Thus the command

kim_style define LennardJones_Ar Ar :pre

will generate the LAMMPS input commands:

pair_style kim LennardJones_Ar
pair_coeff * * Ar :pre

For simulator models, the generated input commands may be more complex
and require that LAMMPS is built with the required packages included.
The commands generated by the kim_style command, can be copied to the
screen or log file, through the "echo"_echo.html command.
The kim_style command will also validate, that the selected simulator
model was generated for the LAMMPS MD code and not some other software.
In addition, the version strings for LAMMPS version used for defining
the simulator model and the LAMMPS version being currently run are
printed, so that it can be tracked down, if there are any incompatible
changes to input script or command syntax between the two LAMMPS versions.

[Restrictions:]

This command is part of the KIM package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  Furthermore, its correct
functioning depends on compiling LAMMPS with all required packages
installed that are required by the commands embedded in any KIM
simulator models used.
See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
