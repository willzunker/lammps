[Description:]

This command sets parameters that affect the energy minimization
algorithms selected by the "min_style"_min_style.html command.  The
various settings may affect the convergence rate and overall number of
force evaluations required by a minimization, so users can experiment
with these parameters to tune their minimizations.

The {cg} and {sd} minimization styles have an outer iteration and an
inner iteration which is steps along a one-dimensional line search in
a particular search direction.  The {dmax} parameter is how far any
atom can move in a single line search in any dimension (x, y, or z).
For the {quickmin} and {fire} minimization styles, the {dmax} setting
is how far any atom can move in a single iteration (timestep).  Thus a
value of 0.1 in real "units"_units.html means no atom will move
further than 0.1 Angstroms in a single outer iteration.  This prevents
highly overlapped atoms from being moved long distances (e.g. through
another atom) due to large forces.

The choice of line search algorithm for the {cg} and {sd} minimization
styles can be selected via the {line} keyword.
The default {quadratic} line search algorithm starts out using
the robust backtracking method described below. However, once
the system gets close to a local
minimum and the linesearch steps get small, so that the energy
is approximately quadratic in the step length, it uses the
estimated location of zero gradient as the linesearch step,
provided the energy change is downhill.
This becomes more efficient than backtracking
for highly-converged relaxations. The {forcezero}
line search algorithm is similar to {quadratic}.
It may be more efficient than {quadratic} on some systems.

The backtracking search is robust and should always find a local energy
minimum.  However, it will "converge" when it can no longer reduce the
energy of the system.  Individual atom forces may still be larger than
desired at this point, because the energy change is measured as the
difference of two large values (energy before and energy after) and
that difference may be smaller than machine epsilon even if atoms
could move in the gradient direction to reduce forces further.

The choice of a norm can be modified for the min styles {cg}, {sd}, 
{quickmin}, {fire}, {spin}, {spin/cg} and {spin/lbfgs} using 
the {norm} keyword.
The default {two} norm computes the 2-norm (Euclidean length) of the
global force vector:

:c,image(Eqs/norm_two.jpg) 

The {max} norm computes the length of the 3-vector force 
for each atom  (2-norm), and takes the maximum value of those across 
all atoms

:c,image(Eqs/norm_max.jpg) 

The {inf} norm takes the maximum component across the forces of
all atoms in the system: 

:c,image(Eqs/norm_inf.jpg) 

For the min styles {spin}, {spin/cg} and {spin/lbfgs}, the force
norm is replaced by the spin-torque norm.

Keywords {alpha_damp} and {discrete_factor} only make sense when
a "min_spin"_min_spin.html command is declared.
Keyword {alpha_damp} defines an analog of a magnetic Gilbert
damping. It defines a relaxation rate toward an equilibrium for
a given magnetic system.
Keyword {discrete_factor} defines a discretization factor for the
adaptive timestep used in the {spin} minimization.
See "min_spin"_min_spin.html for more information about those
quantities. 

The choice of a line search algorithm for the {spin/cg} and
{spin/lbfgs} styles can be specified via the {line} keyword.
The {spin_cubic} and  {spin_none} only make sense when one of those 
two minimization styles is declared.
The {spin_cubic} performs the line search based on a cubic interpolation
of the energy along the search direction. The {spin_none} keyword
deactivates the line search procedure.
The {spin_none} is a default value for {line} keyword for both {spin/lbfgs}
and {spin/cg}. Convergence of {spin/lbfgs} can be more robust if
{spin_cubic} line search is used.

The style {fire2} has several parameters that can be tuned in order
to optimize the relaxation: {integrator}, {tmax}, {tmin}, {delaystep}, {dtgrow}, {dtshrink}, 
{alpha0}, and {alphashrink}.
Different Newton {integrator} can be selected: explicit Euler, 
semi-implicit Euler (= symplectic Euler) and velocity Verlet.
The parameters {tmax} and {tmin} define the maximum and minimum timestep 
allowed during an fire2 minimization. Those are not in time unit, but are 
multiplication factor applied to the "timestep"_timestep.html. Thus 
{tmax} = 10.0 in metal "units"_units.html means that the maximum value
the timestep can be reached during the relaxation is 10 fs (with the default
"timestep"_timestep.html value).
Note that even with the default parameters being chosen to be reliable in most
cases, adjusting "timestep"_timestep.html, {tmax} and {tmin} should be consider
to optimize the minimization, in particular for large/complex system.
An additional stopping criteria {vdfmax} is added in order to avoid unnecessary looping
when it is reasonable to think the system will not be relaxed further.
Note that in this case the system will NOT be relaxed. This could
happen when the system comes to be stuck in a local basin of the phase space. 
{vdfmax} is the maximum number of consecutive iterations with P(t) < 0. 
For debugging purposes, it is possible to switch off the inertia correction 
({halfstepback} = {no}) and the initial delay ({initialdelay} = {no}).

[Restrictions:] 

For magnetic GNEB calculations, only {spin_none} value for {line} keyword can be used
when styles {spin/cg} and {spin/lbfgs} are employed.
See "neb/spin"_neb_spin.html for more explanation.
