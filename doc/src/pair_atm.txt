pair_style atm command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style atm cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for 3-body interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style 2.5
pair_coeff * * * 0.072 :pre

pair_style hybrid/overlay lj/cut 6.5 atm 2.5
pair_coeff * * lj/cut 1.0 1.0
pair_coeff * * atm * 0.072 :pre

[Description:]

The {atm} style computes a 3-body "Axilrod-Teller-Muto"_#Axilrod
potential for the energy E of a system of atoms as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_atm.jpg)

where r12, r23 and r31 are the distances between pairs of atoms,
gamma1 is the angle ???, gamma2 is the angle ???, gamma3 is the angle
???, and nu is the three-body interaction strength.
A diagram of the 3 atoms might help here.

The {atm} potential is typically used in combination with a two-body
potential using the "pair_style hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html
command as in the example above.

--------------------

The rest of this section needs some work to make things more clear.

You need to explain exactly how the cutoff is used.

I don't think this is true:
The calculations are not undertaken if the distances between atoms satisfy
r12 r23 r31 > cutoff^3. 

If r12 > cutoff+skin, then that pair of atoms is not in
the neighbor list, regardless of what r23 and r31 are,
so how can it be computed?

What does this line mean?
Virtual cutoff distance based on a user defined
tolerance tol is not used.

You must explain exactly what the user needs to put
in the input script to model single element and multi-element
systems.

You refer to an ATM potential file, but I don't think there is
such a thing.  There is no code in pair_atm.cpp that reads
a file.  Isn't it all pair_coeff commands?  In LAMMPS lingo,
potential files are the files in the potentials dir.
There is no such thing for ATM, right?

What is the geometry of i,j,k interactions - you don't explain it.
Which one is the central atom?

You say all the K values for a particular I,J must be specified.
I don't see where the code checks for this.

This is the way to word the explation of the per-pair values required:

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the restart files read by the
"read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

?? explain what K is and what are the allowed values
nu (energy/distance^9 units) :ul

Again: what file are you talking about?
The Axilrod-Teller-Muto potential file must contain entries for all the
elements listed in the pair_coeff command.  It can also contain
entries for additional elements not being used in a particular
simulation; LAMMPS ignores those entries.

For a single-element simulation, only a single entry is required
(e.g. 1 1 1).  For a two-element simulation, the file must contain 4
entries (eg. 1 1 1, 1 1 2, 1 2 2, 2 2 2), that
specify ATM parameters for all combinations of the two elements
interacting in three-body configurations.  Thus for 3 elements, 10
entries would be required, etc.

I think a better syntax for the pair coeff command might be this:

pair_coeff I J v1 v2 ... vN

when 1,2,...N are the number of atom types defined.
Then there be one pair_coeff command for each type pair,
the same syntax as all other potentials in LAMMPS use.

Note that you refer to "elements", but the pair coeff command
knows nothing about elements.  Only atom types.  There
could be 10 atom types that all map to the same chemical
element.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair styles do not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the MANYBODY package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Related commands:]

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
