pair_style atm command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style atm cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for 3-body interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style 2.5
pair_coeff * * * 0.072 :pre

pair_style hybrid/overlay lj/cut 6.5 atm 2.5
pair_coeff * * lj/cut 1.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 atm 1 0.064
pair_coeff 1 1 atm 2 0.080
pair_coeff 1 2 atm 2 0.100
pair_coeff 2 2 atm 2 0.125 :pre

[Description:]

The {atm} style computes a 3-body "Axilrod-Teller-Muto"_#Axilrod
potential for the energy E of a system of atoms as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_atm.jpg)

where nu is the three-body interaction strength,
and the distances between pairs of atoms r12, r23 and r31
and the angles gamma1, gamma2 and gamma3
are shown at the diagram:

:c,image(JPG/pair_atm_dia.jpg)

There is no \"central\" atom, the interaction is symmetric with respect
to permutation of atom types.

The {atm} potential is typically used in combination with a two-body
potential using the "pair_style hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html
command as in the example above.

The potential is calculated if all three atoms are in the
"neighbor list"_neighbor.html
and the distances between atoms satisfy r12 r23 r31 > cutoff^3.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the restart files read by the
"read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K - the type of the third atom
nu (energy/distance^9 units) :ul

For a single-atom type simulation, only a single entry is required, eg

pair_coeff 1 1 1 nu :pre

where all three atoms are of type 1.
For a two-atom type simulation, more pair_coeff commands can be used.
ATM interaction is symmetric with respect to permutation of atoms,
it is necessary to provide pair_coeff command for one permutation.
For example, the command

pair_coeff 1 1 2 nu :pre

also implies

pair_coeff 1 2 1 nu
pair_coeff 2 1 1 nu :pre

Thus, to specify all ATM interactions between two atom types (eg 1 and 2)
it is sufficient to provide four pair_coeff commands, eg:

pair_coeff 1 1 1 nu1
pair_coeff 1 1 2 nu2
pair_coeff 1 2 2 nu3
pair_coeff 2 2 2 nu4 :pre

For 3 atom types, 10 pair_coeff commands
(eg 111, 112, 113, 122, 123, 133, 222, 223, 233, 333)
will describe all possible ATM interactions, etc.
It is not necessary to provide the pair_coeff commands for interactions
of all combinations of atom types: if some combination is not defined then
there is no ATM interaction for this combination and all its permutations.

--------------------

[Steve:]

I think a better syntax for the pair coeff command might be this:

pair_coeff I J v1 v2 ... vN

when 1,2,...N are the number of atom types defined.
Then there be one pair_coeff command for each type pair,
the same syntax as all other potentials in LAMMPS use.

[Sergey:]

The reason for my original pair_coeff command syntax is that
I would like to reserve further arguments for possible extension of
ATM potential in LAMMPS to further terms in the multipole expansion of
many-body dispersion interaction.
For example, the next term would be dipole-dipole-quadrupole, it may be
activated if the next argument of pair_coeff is present
without breaking backward compatibility.

Also, the command you propose
(i) will not account that the value of nu for different permutations
of atom types is the same, and
(ii) will make the numbering of atom types messy since there is
no requirement to supply the values of nu for all triplets.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair styles do not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

:line

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the MANYBODY package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Related commands:]

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
