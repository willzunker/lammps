pair_style body/rounded/polygon command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon c_n c_t mu delta_ua cutoff :pre

c_n = normal damping coefficient
c_t = tangential damping coefficient
mu = normal friction coefficient during gross sliding
delta_ua = multiple contact scaling factor
cutoff = global sepration cutoff for interactions (distance units), see below for definition :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon 20.0 5.0 0.0 1.0 0.5
pair_coeff * * 100.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 100.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {body/rounded/polygon} is for use with body particles and calculates pairwise
body/body interactions as well as interactions between body and
point-particles.  See "Section 6.14"_Section_howto.html#howto_14
of the manual and the "body"_body.html doc page for more details on
using body particles.

This pair style is designed for use with the "body/rounded/polygon" body style,
which is specified as an argument to the "atom-style body" command.
See the "body/rounded/polygon"_body.html doc page for more details about the body
styles LAMMPS supports. The pairwise interaction between the rounded polygons is described
in "Fraige"_#Fraige, where the polygons are rounded at the vertices and edges
by circles of diameter a. This is a version of discrete element models (DEM)
with multiple contact points.

Because the polygons can have different rounded diameters, the cutoff specified in
the pair style command is for the surface separation between two interacting entities
(e.g. vertex-vertex, vertex-edge or edge-edge) excluding their rounded diameters,
i.e. separation = center-center distance - (rounded diameter of entity i + rounded diameter of entity j)/2.
The interaction forces and energies are also defined with respect to the rounded surface separation,
instead of center-center distance.

For style {body/rounded/polygon}, the following coefficients must be defined for each
pair of atoms types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in
the examples above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

k_n (energy/distance^2 units)
k_na (energy/distance^2 units) :ul
