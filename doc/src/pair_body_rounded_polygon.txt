pair_style body/rounded/polygon command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon c_n c_t mu delta_ua cutoff :pre

c_n = normal damping coefficient
c_t = tangential damping coefficient
mu = normal friction coefficient during gross sliding
delta_ua = multiple contact scaling factor
cutoff = global separation cutoff for interactions (distance units), see below for definition :pre

NOTE: what does gross sliding mean?

[Examples:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon 20.0 5.0 0.0 1.0 0.5
pair_coeff * * 100.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 100.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {body/rounded/polygon} is for use with 2d models of body
particles of style {rounded/polygon}.  It calculates pairwise
body/body interactions as well as interactions between body and
point-particles.  See "Section 6.14"_Section_howto.html#howto_14 of
the manual and the "body"_body.html doc page for more details on using
body particles.

This pairwise interaction between rounded polygons is described in
"Fraige"_#Fraige, where a polygon does not have sharp corners, but is
rounded at its vertices by circles centered on each vertex with a
specified diameter.  The edges of the polygon are defined bewteen
pairs of adjacent vertices.  The circle diameter for each polygon is
specified in the data file read by the "read data"_read_data.html
command.  This is a 2d discrete element model (DEM) which allows for
multiple contact points.

Note that when two particles interact, the effective surface of each
polygon particle is displaced outward from each of its vertices and
edges by half its circle diameter.  The interaction forces and
energies bewteen two particles are defined with respect to the
separation of their respective rounded surfaces, not by the separation
of the vertices and edges themselves.

This means that the specified cutoff in the pair_style command should
be large enough to encompass the center-to-center distance between two
particles (at any orientation) which would produce a surface-surface
overlap.  For example, consider two square particles with edge length
= 1.0 and circle diameter 0.2.  The maximum distance of one polygon's
surface from its center is not sqrt(2)/2, but (sqrt(2)+0.1)/2.  Thus
the cutoff distance should be sqrt(2) + 0.1, since the surfaces of two
particles that far apart could be touching.

NOTE: Do we need a diagram of 2 overlapping polygon particles that
explains how contact is defined?  Do we need an equation(s) that
explain what the params in pair style and coeff mean, for damping and
spring constants?  Or do we just want to reference the paper for that?

NOTE: say something about no frictional history ?

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom types
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples above,
or in the data file read by the "read_data"_read_data.html command:

k_n (energy/distance^2 units)
k_na (energy/distance^2 units) :ul

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style does not write its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style and
pair_coeff commands in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

These pair styles are part of the BODY package.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

This pair style requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be "on"
for pair interactions.

[Default:] none
