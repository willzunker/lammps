pair_style body/rounded/polygon command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon c_n c_t mu delta_ua cutoff :pre

c_n = normal damping coefficient
c_t = tangential damping coefficient
mu = normal friction coefficient during gross sliding
delta_ua = multiple contact scaling factor
cutoff = global separation cutoff for interactions (distance units), see below for definition :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon 20.0 5.0 0.0 1.0 0.5
pair_coeff * * 100.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 100.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {body/rounded/polygon} is for use with 2d models of body
particles of style {rounded/polygon}.  It calculates pairwise
body/body interactions as well as interactions between body and point
particles.  See "Section 6.14"_Section_howto.html#howto_14 of the
manual and the "body"_body.html doc page for more details on using
body particles.

This pairwise interaction between rounded polygons is described in
"Fraige"_#Fraige, where a polygon does not have sharp corners, but is
rounded at its vertices by circles centered on each vertex with a
specified diameter.  The edges of the polygon are defined between
pairs of adjacent vertices.  The circle diameter for each polygon is
specified in the data file read by the "read data"_read_data.html
command.  This is a 2d discrete element model (DEM) which allows for
multiple contact points.

Note that when two particles interact, the effective surface of each
polygon particle is displaced outward from each of its vertices and
edges by half its circle diameter (as in the diagram below of a gray
and yellow square particle).  The interaction forces and energies
between two particles are defined with respect to the separation of
their respective rounded surfaces, not by the separation of the
vertices and edges themselves.

This means that the specified cutoff in the pair_style command should
be large enough to encompass the center-to-center distance between two
particles (at any orientation) which would produce an overlap of the
two surfaces.  For example, consider two square particles with edge
length = 1.0 and circle diameter 0.2.  The maximum distance of one
polygon's surface from its center is not sqrt(2)/2, but
(sqrt(2)+0.1)/2.  Thus the cutoff distance should be sqrt(2) + 0.1,
since the surfaces of two particles that far apart could be touching.

The forces between vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, and edge-edge overlaps
are given by:

In "Fraige"_#Fraige, the tangential friction force between two
particles that are in contact is modeled differently prior to gross
sliding (i.e. static friction) and during gross-sliding (kinetic
friction).  The latter takes place when the tangential deformation
exceeds the Coulomb frictional limit.  In the current implementation,
however, we do not take into account frictional history, i.e. we do
not keep track of how many time steps the two particles have been in
contact nor calculate the tangential deformation.  Instead, we assume
that gross sliding takes place as soon as two particles are in
contact.

TRUNG: The diagram label "cohesive regions" confuses me.  Are you
saying there is some distance d for which the force is attractive,
i.e. the particles are cohesive?  I think when d > Ri + Rj, since Ri +
Rj is the surface/surface overlap discussed above?  If so, then the
discussion above about the specified cutoff is wrong?  I.e. you can
specify a large cutoff than the surface/surface overlap to get
cohesive interactions?  If so, this should be explained up above.
But an additional confusion is that the specied cutoff (Rc in diagram?)
is a single number, but depedning on the orientiation of the 2
particles they might have a suface/surface overlap at a much
smaller value of Ri + Rj.  So what is Rc then?

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom types
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples above,
or in the data file read by the "read_data"_read_data.html command:

k_n (energy/distance^2 units)
k_na (energy/distance^2 units) :ul

Effectively, k_n and k_na are the slopes of the red lines in the plot
above for force versus distance, for r < 0 and 0 < r < rc
respectively.  TRUNG: is this sentence correct?

TRUNG: reminder to copy any change in this file
to the pair polyhedron file as well (and vice versa)

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style does not write its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style and
pair_coeff commands in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

These pair styles are part of the BODY package.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

This pair style requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be "on"
for pair interactions.
