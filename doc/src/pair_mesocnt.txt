pair_style mesocnt command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style mesocnt :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style mesocnt
pair_coeff * * 10_10.cnt :pre

[Description:]

Style {mesocnt} implements a mesoscopic potential
for the interaction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In this potential,
CNTs are modelled as chains of cylindrical segments in which
each infinitesimal surface element interacts with all other
CNT surface elements with the Lennard-Jones (LJ) term adopted from
the "airebo"_pair_airebo.html style. The interation energy
is then computed by integrating over the surfaces of all interacting
CNTs.

The potential is based on interactions between one cylindrical
segment and infinitely or semi-infinitely long CNTs as described
in "(Volkov1)"_#Volkov1. Chains of segments are
converted to these (semi-)infinite CNTs bases on an approximate
chain approach outlined in "(Volkov2)"_#Volkov2.
This allows to simplify the computation of the interactions
significantly and reduces the computational times to the
same order of magnitude as for regular bead spring models
where beads interact with the standard "pair_lj/cut"_pair_lj.html
potential.

In LAMMPS, cylindrical segments are represented by bonds. Each
segment is defined by its two end points ("nodes") which correspond
to atoms in LAMMPS. For the exact functional form of the potential
and implementation details, the reader is referred to the 
original papers "(Volkov1)"_#Volkov1 and 
"(Volkov2)"_#Volkov2.

The potential requires tabulated data provided in a single ASCII 
text file specified in the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command. 
The first line of the file provides a time stamp and
general information. The second line lists four integers giving
the number of data points provided in the subsequent four
data tables. The third line lists four floating point numbers: 
the CNT radius R, the LJ parameter sigma and two numerical 
parameters delta1 and delta2. These four parameters are given
in Angstroms. This is followed by four data tables each separated
by a single empty line. The first two tables have two columns
and list the parameters uInfParallel and Gamma respectively.
The last two tables have three columns giving data on a quadratic
array and list the parameters Phi and uSemiParallel respectively.
uInfParallel and uSemiParallel are given in eV/Angstrom, Phi is
given in eV and Gamma is unitless.

Potential files for CNTs can be readily generated using the freely 
available code provided on

https://github.com/phankl/cntpot

Using the same approach, it should also be possible to
generate potential files for other 1D systems such as
boron nitride nanotubes.

NOTE: LAMMPS comes with one {mesocnt} style potential file
where the default number of data points per table is 1001.
This is sufficient for NVT simulations. For proper energy
conservation, we recommend using a potential file where
the resolution for Phi is at least 2001 data points.

NOTE: The {mesocnt} style requires CNTs to be represented
as a chain of atoms connected by bonds. Atoms need
to be numbered consecutively within one chain. 
Atoms belonging to different CNTs need to be assigned
different molecule IDs.

A full summary of the method and LAMMPS implementation details
are expected to soon become available in Computer Physics
Communications.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support mixing.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift, table, and tail options.

The mesocnt pair style do not write their information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, since it is stored in tabulated potential files.
Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style and pair_coeff commands in
an input script that reads a restart file.

These pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  They do not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

The mesocnt style is part of the USER-MESOCNT package. It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This pair potential requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be
"on" for pair interactions.

[Default:] none
