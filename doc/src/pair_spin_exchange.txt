pair_style pair/spin/exchange command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style pair/spin/exchange cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff pair (distance in metal units) :ulb,l

:ule
	
[Examples:]

pair_style pair/spin/exchange 4.0	
pair_coeff * * exchange 4.0 0.0446928 0.003496 1.4885
pair_coeff 1 2 exchange 6.0 -0.01575 0.0 1.965 :pre

[Description:]

Style {pair/spin/exchange} computes the exchange interaction between 
pairs of magnetic spins. 

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_exchange_interaction.pdf)

where si and sj are two neighboring magnetic spins of two particles, 
rij = ri - rj is the inter-atomic distance between the two particles,
and J(rij) is a function defining the intensity and the sign of the exchange 
interaction.  

This function is defined as:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_exchange_function.pdf)

where a, b and d are the three constants defined in the associated "pair_coeff"
command.   

More explanations the {pair/spin/exchange} and its parametrization are reported 
in "(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida1.



The {lj/cut} and {lj/cut/coul/long} pair styles support the use of the
{inner}, {middle}, and {outer} keywords of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command, meaning the pairwise forces can be

:line

[Restrictions:]

All the {pair/spin} styles are part of the SPIN package. 
These styles are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with this package, and
if the atom_style "spin" was declared. 
See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.
