pair_style spin/exchange command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style spin/exchange cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff pair (distance in metal units) :ulb,l

:ule

[Examples:]

pair_style spin/exchange 4.0
pair_coeff * * exchange 4.0 0.0446928 0.003496 1.4885
pair_coeff 1 2 exchange 6.0 -0.01575 0.0 1.965 :pre

[Description:]

Style {spin/exchange} computes the exchange interaction between 
pairs of magnetic spins:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_exchange_interaction.jpg)

where si and sj are two neighboring magnetic spins of two particles, 
rij = ri - rj is the inter-atomic distance between the two particles,
and J(rij) is a function defining the intensity and the sign of the exchange 
interaction.

This function is defined as:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_exchange_function.jpg)

where a, b and d are the three constant coefficients defined in the associated
"pair_coeff" command.

The coefficients a, b, and d need to be fitted so that the function above matches with
the value of the exchange interaction for the N neighbor shells taken into account.

Examples and more explanations about this function and its parametrization are reported
in "(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida3.

From this exchange interaction, each spin i will be submitted 
to a magnetic torque omega, and its associated atom can be submitted to a
force F for spin-lattice calculations (see "fix_nve_spin"_fix_nve_spin.html),
such as:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_exchange_forces.jpg)

with h the Planck constant (in metal units).

More details about the derivation of these torques/forces are reported in
"(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida3.

[Restrictions:]

All the {pair/spin} styles are part of the SPIN package. 
These styles are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with this package, and
if the atom_style "spin" was declared. 
See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Default:] none
