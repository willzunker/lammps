pair_style spin/long command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style spin/long cutoff (cutoff)

cutoff = global cutoff pair (distance in metal units) :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

pair_style spin/long 10.0
pair_coeff * * long 10.0
pair_coeff 2 3 long 8.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {pair/spin/long} computes interactions between pairs of particles
that each have a magnetic spin.  

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_long_range.jpg)

where si and sj are two magnetic spins of two particles with Lande factors 
gi and gj respectively, eij = (ri - rj)/|ri-rj| is the unit vector between 
sites i and j, mu0 the vacuum permeability, muB the Bohr magneton (muB = 
5.788 eV/T in metal units). 

Style {pair/spin/long} computes magnetic precession vectors:

with h the Planck constant (in metal units), and a mechanical force:

The following coefficient must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

rc (distance units) :ul

with rc is the radius cutoff of the short-range component of the 
long-range interaction (see "(Cerda)"_#Cerda1 for more
explanation).

[Restrictions:]

The {pair/spin/long} style is part of the SPIN package. It is only 
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. See the 
"Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

The {pair/spin/long} style computes the short-range component of
the dipole-dipole interaction. The functions evaluating the 
long-range component are part of the KSPACE package.
They can be enabled only if LAMMPS was built with that package.
