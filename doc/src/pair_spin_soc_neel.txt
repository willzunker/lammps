pair_style pair/spin/soc/neel command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style pair/spin/soc/neel cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff pair (distance in metal units) :ulb,l

:ule
	
[Examples:]

pair_style pair/spin/soc/neel 4.0
pair_coeff * * neel 4.0 0.0048 0.234 1.168 2.6905 0.705 0.652
pair_coeff 1 2 neel 4.0 0.0048 0.234 1.168 0.0 0.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Styles {pair/spin/soc} compute pair interactions arising from the spin-orbit 
coupling (soc). 

Style {pair/spin/soc/neel} computes the Neel pair anisotropy model 
between pairs of magnetic spins: 

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_soc_dmi_interaction.jpg)

where si and sj are two neighboring magnetic spins of two particles, 
rij = ri - rj is the inter-atomic distance between the two particles,
and D(rij) is the DM vector defining the intensity and the 
sign of the exchange interaction.

This function is defined as:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_exchange_function.jpg)

where a, b and d are the three constant coefficients defined in the associated 
"pair_coeff" command.   

The coefficients a, b, and d need to be fitted so that the function above matches with 
the value of the DM interaction for the N neighbor shells taken 
into account.

Examples and more explanations about this function and its parametrization are reported 
in "(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida1.

From this DM interaction, each spin i will be submitted to a magnetic torque
omega and its associated atom to a force F (for spin-lattice calculations only), 
such as: 

:c,image(Eqs/pair_spin_soc_dmi_forces.jpg)

with h the Planck constant (in metal units).

More details about the derivation of these torques/forces are reported in
"(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida1.

[Restrictions:]

All the {pair/spin} styles are part of the SPIN package. 
These styles are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with this package, and
if the atom_style "spin" was declared. 
See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.
