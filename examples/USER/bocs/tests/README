This folder contains a variety of input/output files for the
USER-BOCS code that exercises both error handling and all three
analysis modes (analytic, linear spline, and cubic spline).

In the absence of automated testing, the bash script, runTests.sh
may be used to generate a folder of log files which can be
compared to the baseline file set in logsCompareFileSet to
look for material changes.
