This directory contains example data and input files 
as well as utility scripts for the oxDNA/oxDNA2/oxRNA2 
coarse-grained model for DNA and RNA.

/examples/oxDNA/duplex1:
/examples/oxDNA2/duplex1:

Input, data and log files for a DNA duplex (double-stranded DNA) 
consisiting of 5 base pairs. The duplex contains two strands with 
complementary base pairs. The topology is

A - C - G - T - A
|   |   |   |   |
T - G - C - A - T     

Note that in this example the stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions 
are sequence-averaged (cf. keyword 'seqav' in according pair styles).

/******************************************************************************/

/examples/oxDNA/duplex2:
/examples/oxDNA2/duplex2:

Input, data and log files for a nicked DNA duplex (double-stranded DNA) 
consisiting of 8 base pairs. The duplex contains strands with 
complementary base pairs, but the backbone on one side is not continuous: 
two individual strands on one side form a duplex with a longer single 
strand on the other side. The topology is

A - C - G - T - A - C - G - T
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
T - G - C - A   T - G - C - A

Note that in this example the stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions 
are sequence-averaged (cf. keyword 'seqav' in according pair styles).

/******************************************************************************/

/examples/oxDNA2/duplex3:

This is the duplex1 run with sequence-dependent stacking and
hydrogen-bonding strengths enabled and both nucleotide mass and 
moment of inertia set to the value of the standalone implementation 
of oxDNA (M = I = 1). To achieve this, the masses can be set directly 
in the input and data file, whereas the moment of inertia is set via 
the diameter of the ellipsoid in the data file and has a value of 3.16227766.
The change of mass and moment of inertia allows direct comparision of 
e.g. trajectory data, energies or time-dependent observables on a per-timestep 
basis until numerical noise causes deviations at later simulation times. 

As mentioned above, the stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions 
are sequence-dependent (cf. keyword 'seqdep' in according pair styles).

/******************************************************************************/

/examples/oxRNA2/duplex4

This is the duplex2 run with the oxRNA2 force field instead of the oxDNA or 
oxDNA2 force field  and sequence-dependent stacking and hydrogen-bonding 
strengths enabled.

/util:
This directory contains a simple python setup tool which creates 
single straight or helical DNA strands, DNA duplexes or arrays of DNA 
duplexes.
