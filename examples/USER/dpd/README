This directory contains input files for DPD simulations under
isothermal, isoenergetic, isobaric and isoenthalpic conditions.  In
addition, there is also an example for a reaction DPD simulation under
isoenergetic conditions.  All the DPD scenarios use the Shardlow
splitting algorithm to integrate the equations of motion.  The compute
dpd command is used in the isoenergetic and isenthalpic case to
demonstrate how one can access the particle internal energies.
