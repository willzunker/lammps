RENE: this dir needs a few short-running examples,
for both 1 and 4 procs, of using different Scafacos methods.
with sample log file outputs - so users can verify
they are running it correctly

For each input script, there should be files like

in.scafacos.fmm
log.20Jul18.scafacos.fmm.g++.1
log.20Jul18.scafacos.fmm.g++.4
