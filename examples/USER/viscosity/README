The input script in in.1000SPCE.lmp gives an example on how to calculate
the shear viscosity of SPCE water with the periodic perturbation method.
For a production run, much longer simulation is required.
Note that the acceleration amplitude of `fix accelerate/cos` should be carefully chosen,
and an extrapolation is generally required to get the viscosity at zero-shear.
