README for MLIAPPY Example

These examples run the Ta06 example from the MLIAP package, but using the python coupling.

1: Running models using LAMMPS executable: in.mliap.snap.Ta06A.

To run this, first run convert_mliap_Ta06A.py, which will convert the Ta06 potential into a pytorch model.
It will be saved as "Ta06A.mliap.pytorch.model.pkl".

It will also copy the "mliappy_pytorch.py" file into the current working directory. mliappy_pytorch.py contains
class definitions suitable for wrapping an arbitrary energy model MLIAPPY. It must be available to python when
creating or unpicking a pytorch model for MLIAPPY.

From that point you can run the example lmp -in in.mliap.snap.Ta06A -echo both

2: Running models from python with LAMMPS in library mode: load_external.py

Before testing this, ensure that the first example (using LAMMPS executable) works.

Not all python installations support this mode of operation. 
Too test if your interpreter supports this, run:
`python test_pylibs.py`
 and examine the output.

If this succeeds, you should be able to run:
`python load_external.py`
