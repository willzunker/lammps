The input script in.22DMH.relres provide example of simulation using
Relative Resolution (RelRes) potential.  In this example 2,2-Dimethylhexane
is selected as simulated substance to give complete view of the RelRes
utilization.

This script uses data file Data.22DMH.in.relres consisting of 8000 molecules.
It also generates RelRes potential for selected atom types.

The input script in.22DMH.respa demonstrates the use of the lj/relres pair
style with r-RESPA using multi-timestepping between FG and CG sites using
a hybrid pair style configuration.
