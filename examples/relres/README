The input script in.22DMH.relres provide example of simulation using Relative Resolution (RelRes) potential.
In this example 2,2-Dimethylhexane is selected as simulated substance to give complete view of the RelRes utilization.

This script uses data file Data.22DMH.in.relres consisting 8000 molecule of the substance. It also generates RelRes potential for selected atom types.
