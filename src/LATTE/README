This package provides a fix latte command which is a wrapper on the
LATTE DFTB code, so that molecular dynamics can be run with LAMMPS
using density-functional tight-binding quantum forces calculated by
LATTE.  More information on LATTE can be found at "web site".  Its
authors are Anders Niklasson, etc at LANL.

Using this package requires the LATTE code to be downloaded and built
as a library on your system.  The library can be downloaded and built
in lib/latte or elsewhere on your system, which must be done before
building LAMMPS with this package.  Details of the download, build, and
install process for LATTE are given in the lib/latte/README file, and
scripts are provided to help automate the process.  

Also see the LAMMPS manual for general information on building LAMMPS
with external libraries.  The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in
lib/latte must be correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this
package installed.  However, the default settings should be correct in
most cases and the Makefile.lammps file usually will not need to be
changed.

Once you have successfully built LAMMPS with this package and the
LATTE library you can test it using an input file from the examples
dir:

./lmp_serial < lammps/examples/latte/in.latte

This pair style was written in collaboration with the LATTE
developers.
