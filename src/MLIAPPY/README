This package provides a coupling to PyTorch energy models
via the MLIAP package.

Before compiling LAMMPS with either make or cmake, you have
to run cythonize to create the coupling source files
in the src/MLIAPPY directory e.g.

cd MLIAPPY
cythonize mliap_model_python_couple.pyx

When building with make, you will have to add this 
compiler option, suitably modified for your NumPy:

-I/home/athomps/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include

When bulding with cmake, it should just work, but if you have 
cmake version older than 3.14, you will have to edit
this file accordingly:
more ../../cmake/Modules/Packages/MLIAPPY.cmake
if(CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_LESS 3.14)
:
  target_include_directories(lammps PRIVATE /home/athomps/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include)
