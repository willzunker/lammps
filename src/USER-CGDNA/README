This package contains a LAMMPS implementation of coarse-grained
models of DNA, which can be used to model sequence-specific
DNA strands.

See the doc pages and [1,2] for the individual bond and pair styles. 
The packages contains also a new Langevin-type rigid-body integrator,
which has also its own doc page and is explained in [3].

Example input and data files can be found in
/examples/USER/cgdna/examples/duplex1/ and /duplex2/.  A simple python
setup tool which creates single straight or helical DNA strands as
well as DNA duplexes and arrays of duplexes can be found in
/examples/USER/cgdna/util/.  A technical report with more information
on the model, the structure of the input and data file, the setup tool
and the performance of the LAMMPS-implementation of oxDNA can be found
in /doc/src/PDF/USER-CGDNA-overview.pdf.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This package can only be used if LAMMPS is compiled
with the MOLECULE and ASPHERE packages.  These should be included in
the LAMMPS build by typing "make yes-asphere yes-molecule" prior to
the usual compilation (see the "Including/excluding packages" section
of the LAMMPS manual).
