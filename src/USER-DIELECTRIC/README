* Description

The USER-DIELECTRIC package provides several solvers for computing surface induced charges:
  * the boundary element method using the GMRES solver (fix polarize/bem/gmres),
  * the induced charge computation (ICC*) (fix polarize/bem/icc), and
  * the direct optimization of an energy functional derived from the variational approach (fix polarize/functional).

See the header of the source files for more details on the references of the methods.
Example input scripts are given at examples/USER/dielectric.

The USER-DIELECTRIC package was created by Trung Nguyen while at Northwestern,
with contribution from Honghao Li (FixQeqDielectric) while at Northwestern.

Questions can be addressed to Trung Nguyen (ndactrung@gmail.com).

* Installation

1. Clone the git repo: git clone https://bitbucket.org/ndtrung/lammps.git

2. Check out the dielectric branch: git checkout dielectric

3. Build: go to src/, and run

make yes-molecule

make yes-kspace

make yes-user-dielectric

a. If you don't have GSL libraries (libgsl.a and libgslcblas.a) installed in your machine,
remove fix_qeq_dielectric.cpp and fix_qeq_dielectric.h. Then build with

make mpi -j8


b. If you do have GSL headers and libraries installed, assuming that they are in /path/to/gsl/install,
copy MAKE/Makefile.mpi to MAKE/Makefile.mpi_gsl, and add to the variables CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS
in MAKE/Makefile.mpi_gsl:

GSL_PATH = /path/to/gsl/install

...

CCFLAGS =	-O2 -march=native -funroll-loops -ffast-math -fopenmp -I$(GSL_PATH)/include

...

LINKFLAGS =     -O2 -fopenmp -L$(GSL_PATH)/lib

LIB =           -lgsl -lgslcblas

Finally, build with

make mpi_gsl -j8

* Test

Go to examples/USER/dielectric, and run

mpirun -np 8 ../../../src/lmp_mpi -in in.confined

or with the modified Makefile.mpi_gsl:

mpirun -np 8 ../../../src/lmp_mpi_gsl -in in.confined
