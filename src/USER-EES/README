This package implements the EES potential between ellipsoidal particles and a semi finite LJ wall introduced by Babadi and Ejtehadi. 

This potential has fixes in both "fix wall" style and "fix wall/region" style so can be used as a boundary of simulation box or on the sides of a region inside the simulation box. 

The ASPHERE package is required for using this fixes.

For more details please refer to documentation of LAMMPS under "fix wall/ees" entry. 
There are also some example of using this code in /examples/usr/EES.

This implementation is done by Abdoreza Ershadinia at Sharif University of Technology--Tehran (a.ershdinia@physics.sahrif.edu).
