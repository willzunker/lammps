This package contains implementation of stochastic boundary conditions which can be used in fluid transport in pore.
Those are statistical models which describe how fluid atoms are reflected after collisions with the wall. Three models are used:
Diffusive wall: the gas atoms are reflected diffusively
Maxwell model: the gas atoms are partially reflected diffusively (using 1 accommodation coefficients)
Anisotropic Cercignani Lampis model: 3 accommodations coefficients are used.

There are an example for using commands in this package in the same directory
