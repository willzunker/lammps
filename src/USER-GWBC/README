This package contains implementation of stochastic boundary conditions which can be used for simulating fluid transport in a confined space limited by walls.
Those are statistical models which describe how fluid atoms are reflected after collisions with the wall. Three models are used:
Diffusive wall: the gas atoms are reflected diffusively
Maxwell model: the gas atoms are partially reflected diffusively (using 1 accommodation coefficients)
Anisotropic Cercignani Lampis model: 3 accommodations coefficients are used.

There are an example for using commands in this package in the same directory
