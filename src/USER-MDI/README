The USRE-MDI package adds an mdi_engine command which enables LAMMPS
to operate as a MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) engine, responding to
commands from an external MDI driver.

It uses the MDI Library, which is available at
https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library.  The MDI Library is
developed and maintained by Taylor Barnes at the Molecular Sciences
Software Institute (MolSSI).

For more information about using MDI with LAMMPS, see the LAMMPS
documentation for the mdi_engine command and the mdi/engine fix.
For general purpose information about MDI, see the MDI Library
documentation:
https://molssi-mdi.github.io/MDI_Library/html/index.html

The MDI Library is required in order to use this package, and can be
built using the Install.py file in lib/mdi.  For example:

python Install.py -m gcc
python Install.py -m icc
