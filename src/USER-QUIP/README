This package provides enables the pair_style quip command. This pair style 
provides an interface to the QUIP/libAtoms MD framework, which includes a 
variety of interatomic potentials, including the GAP potential.

See lib/quip/README for more information on how to build LAMMPS
with this package.

See examples/USER/quip for several test examples that run QUIP
potentials.
