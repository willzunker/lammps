# Singularity container definitions for compiling/testing LAMMPS

The *.def files in this folder can be used to build container images
for [Singularity](https://sylabs.io) suitable for compiling and testing
LAMMPS on a variety of OS variants with support for most standard packages
and building/spellchecking the manual. This allows to test and debug
LAMMPS code on different OS variants than what is locally installed on
your development workstation, e.g. when bugs are reported that can only
be reproduced on a specific OS or with specific (mostly older) versions
of tools, compilers, or libraries.

Here is a workflow for testing a compilation of LAMMPS with a CentOS 7.x container.

```
cd some/work/directory
git clone --depth 500  git://github.com/lammps/lammps.git lammps
mkdir build-centos7
cd build-centos7
sudo singularity build centos7.sif ../tools/singularity/centos7.def
singularity shell centos7.sif
cmake ../cmake -C ../cmake/presets/most.cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -g -fopenmp -std=c++11"
make
```

| Currently available: |     |
| --- | --- |
| centos7.def | CentOS 7.x with EPEL enabled |
| ubuntu18.04.def | Ubuntu 18.04LTS with default MPI == OpenMPI |
